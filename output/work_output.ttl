Sennonché, l’efficacia di questa previsione è stata poi annullata dall’introduzione di un meccanismo di indicizzazione del tasso di interesse legale che ha riconosciuto una modestissima remunerazione, generalmente molto inferiore a quella ricavabile da un qualsiasi investimento finanziario." ;

Here we report on the first artificial selection experiment designed to test the existence of genetically-based correlations between sex functions in hermaphroditic animals. The polychaete worm Ophryotrocha diadema has a long juvenile male phase, and then shifts to the simultaneously hermaphroditic phase. We selected two sets of lines of worms for a short male phase and, after four generations, worms had a significantly shorter male phase than their generation-0 ancestors. As negatively correlated responses, generation-4 worms spent more time maturing eggs and produced a higher number of eggs at 1st laying than worms of generation 0. Both traits contributed to the female function and were not the target of the selection experiment. In contrast, selection was ineffective in the lines descending from phenotypically-hermaphroditic worms that reproduced only via their male function. Our results provide the first empirical support of a genetic basis for a trade-off between traits related to the male and female function in hermaphroditic animals and highlight that these trade-offs are complex. Our results also suggest that the trade-off between male and female functions breaks up as hermaphrodites evolve some sexual specialization where resources are channeled towards a single sexual function." ;

Mixed AdenoNeuroEndocrine Carcinomas (MANECs) of the gastrointestinal\ntract are rare neoplasms characterized by coexisting exocrine and neuroendocrine neoplastic\ncomponents. MANECs' histogenetic classification and molecular characterization remain\nunclear, significantly affecting the identification of innovative therapeutic options for these\ntumors. Methods. In this study, the exocrine and neuroendocrine components of 6\ngastrointestinal MANECs were microdissected and subjected to the simultaneous mutation\nassessment in selected regions of 54 cancer-associated genes, using Ion Torrent\nsemiconductor-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). Sanger sequencing and\nimmunohistochemistry were used as validation of the mutational status. Results. A total of\n20 driver gene somatic mutations were observed among the 12 neoplastic components\ninvestigated. In 11 of 12 (91.7%) samples at least one mutation was detected; 7 samples\n(58.3%) were found to have multiple mutations. TP53 gene mutations were the most frequent\ngenetic alterations observed in the series, occurring in 11/12 samples (91.7%). Somatic\nmutations in other genes were detected at lower frequencies: ATM, CTNNB1, ERBB4, JAK3,\nKDR, KRAS, RB1. Conclusions. Five of the six MANECs presented an overlapping\nmutational profile in both components, suggesting a monoclonal origin of the two MANEC\ncomponents." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Riassunto. Un’estesa documentazione scientifica ha dimostrato come i determinanti socioeconomici influenzino il bisogno di salute e, per questa via, il fabbisogno di risorse assistenziali: la salute cresce infatti al crescere del vantaggio sociale, con un gradiente regolare osservabile indipendentemente dall’indicatore sociale misurato; le condizioni socioeconomiche degli individui hanno un impatto sulla salute maggiore delle caratteristiche sociali dei contesti di vita, benché queste ultime esercitino comunque un effetto indipendente sulla salute. L’Associazione Italiana di Epidemiologia ha chiesto ai suoi esperti di fare il punto sulle conoscenze scientifiche riguardanti il rapporto tra deprivazione socioeconomica, salute e fabbisogno di risorse per l’assistenza sanitaria. Le conclusioni di tale approfondimento mostrano come l’indice di deprivazione socioeconomica, disponibile in Italia a livello aggregato, sia capace di predire, insieme all’età, l’erogazione dei livelli di assistenza ed il relativo assorbimento di risorse assistenziali, in modo coerente con quanto atteso dai dati di letteratura. Tuttavia l’intensità e l’interpretazione di tale relazione risultano influenzate da questioni metodologiche, tali da stimolare gli esperti verso percorsi di perfezionamento dell’indice o suggerire investimenti anche su altri strumenti informativi per la stima del fabbisogno sanitario. \nAbstract. A wide scientific documentation showed how the socio-economic determinants affect the health needs and, therefore, the welfare resource needs. Actually, health increases if the social advantage increases, and this can be observed regardless of the measured social index. The socio-economic conditions of people have a higher impact on their health compared to the social characteristics of the life contexts, although these affect anyway people’s health. The Italian Epidemiology Association asked its experts to sum up the scientific knowledge concerning the relationship between the socio-economic deprivation and the health and resource needs for the national health care. The outcomes of such research show how the socio-economic deprivation index available in Italy is able to foresee – at aggregated level and together with the age – the care levels and the relevant welfare resource needs consistently with what expected from the literature data. However, the strength and the interpretation of such relationship are influenced by methodological issues that lead experts to develop the index or to suggest investments also in other information tools in order to define the health needs." ;

Numerous studies have investigated the effects of the mouthguard on sports performance without detecting significant changes in maximum oxygen consumption or explosive and explosive-elastic strength. \nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the variation in acute sub-maximal strength exercises in both the upper and lower limbs with and without the use of a self-adapted mouthguard in a group of athletes training with overloads. \nMETHODS Ten male athletes (26±5 years, weight 80±11 kg, 180±1 cm) divided into two groups, were studied. The subjects were trained for at least five years, three days a week and had never used a mouthguard. In this study, Kipsta (Decathlon SA, France) self-adapted mouthguards was used. The test protocol involved the search of the maximum load (kg) lifted by 5 maximum repetitions (5RM) with and without the use of the mouthguard (counterbalanced measures design). \nRESULTS Data analysis using the Wilcoxon paired test showed a not significant difference in strength with and without the use of the MG in the performed exercises: bench press (ns, +2%); lat machine (ns; +4%), overhead press (ns, +2%), curl bar (ns; +1%), push down (ns, +2%), squat (ns; +3%). In order to reinforce this observation, all tests with and without the MG were evaluated together. \nThe data analysis (T-test) showed higher values of strength without the use of the MG (p <0.01, +2%). \nCONCLUSION\nThe study carried out highlights how, in a group of athletes training with weights, the acute use of self-adapted mouthguards cause significant negative variation in the maximal dynamic strength." ;

Avant de nous pencher sur le rôle identitaire de la langue d’entreprise nous avons essayé d’identifier les stratégies politiques et commerciales de ces entreprises qui montrent une certaine variété au niveau des choix linguistiques et des représentations géo-commerciales. Cela sous-tend aussi des stratégies communicationnelles variées qui, à travers l’enjeu du multilinguisme, révèlent un positionnement qui est sans doute commercial, mais aussi identitaire et culturel. La communication multilingue entame donc un processus de négociation entre une « identité langagière source » revendiquant des origines, une histoire, une appartenance géographique, sociale, culturelle (nationale, régionale, du métier), « une altérité cible » qui peut être plus ou moins définie, toujours plus multiculturelle, et, nous ajouterons « une altérité source ». \nNotre étude s’attachera dans un premier temps à définir le terrain d’enquête, ensuite à montrer les choix communicationnels linguistiques et culturels dans les sites corporate des entreprises agro-alimentaires italiennes et françaises pour dégager enfin les marqueurs identitaires propres à la langue corporate entre figement et métissage, ce qui dénote l’émergence d’une porosité culturelle de la langue d’entreprise qui va vers des formes « plurielles »." ;

The project consists of the development of an e-based teaching and learning environment. The project is motivated by the lack of English language teaching and learning materials related to the profession of the social worker, at least, on the Italian market, where attention is more drawn to English for other purposes (e.g.: business, law, and medicine). The aim is to provide language learners with resources which can be used beside those which are currently available. These consist of two manuals which have been prepared specifically: one is addressed to beginners and learners with basic notions of English grammar and lexis, whereas the other manual is used with students whose level of English is pre-intermediate.\n\nFor the realisation of the present project, corpus linguistics methodology has been applied. A corpus of about three million words has been built. The texts included in the corpus deal with topics connected to the profession of social worker. Some have been selected for reading comprehension activities and provide the learners with links to the concordances of some highlighted terms which are considered as relevant to the language of the profession. The availability of a key term list has been useful for the building of a glossary of reference." ;

Thirteen cases of cocaine and 100 cases of morphine related deaths were studied. Cardiovascular and hepatic findings were analyzed, respectively, for cocaine and morphine acute lethal intoxication. For cocaine in one case of cocaine acute intoxication, the cause of death was induced by the rupture of   a Berry aneurism: in five cases  a right ventricular dysplasia was considered a contributory factor. Left ventricular hypertrophy and histological evidence of myocardial patchy fibrosis were constantly observed. The absence of myocardial nodular fibrosis was related with the phenomenon o f cocaine use by the voung in Italy. In morphine related deaths, non specific, chronic, persistent lobular and active hepatitis were constatntly observed at  virtually the same rate. The hepatic rindings observed were more serious than those described in literature for similar case reports, and were presumed to be related to the influence of the endemic HCV infection present in our region." ;

Four lesions involved the right gland, and three the left; they ranged from 3 to 12.5 cm in diameter. Magnetic resonance was able to image all lesions. Using T1-weighted sequences, three structural patterns were observed; (a) homogeneous masses with intensity equal to adjacent fat (three cases); (b) heterogeneous masses with fat intensity areas and areas similar to renal cortex (two cases); and (c) nodules quite different from fat, hypointense to the liver (two cases). On T2-weighted images, myelolipomas were slightly hypointense to fat and either hypo- or isointense to the liver. A comparison with the results of CT studies was possible in all cases, and good correlation with determination of the presence and quantity of fat density tissues within the lesions was observed. However, MR imaging did not seem to help in diagnosing adrenal myelolipoma in patients with equivocal CT findings, and needle biopsy is still needed in difficult cases." ;

In view of the above, this work describes basic medico-legal criteria, by which the medical profession can avoid being held liable for fatal events and points out the various elements that may lead to mistakes when drafting certificates (judgements) of fitness in sports.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) provides good evidence for the presence of pancreatitis (recommendation C) and it should be carried out 48-72 h after the onset of symptoms in patients with predicted severe pancreatitis. Severity assessment is essential for the selection of the proper initial treatment in the management of acute pancreatitis (recommendation A) and should be done using the APACHE II score, serum C-reactive protein and CT assessment (recommendation C). The etiology of acute pancreatitis should be able to be determined in at least 80% of cases (recommendation B). An adequate volume of intravenous fluid should be administered promptly to correct the volume deficit and maintain basal fluid requirements (recommendation A); analgesia is crucial for the correct treatment of the disease (recommendation A). Enteral feeding is indicated in severe necrotizing pancreatitis and it is better than total parenteral nutrition (recommendation A). The use of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics reduces infection rates in CT-proven necrotizing pancreatitis (recommendation A). Infected pancreatic necrosis in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis is an indication for intervention, including surgery and radiological drainage (recommendation B).\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe participants agreed to revise the guidelines every 3 years in order to re-evaluate each question on the management of acute pancreatitis patients according to the most recent literature." ;

Quali sono le ragioni di tale esclusione? Perché nella storia della filosofia sono presenti poche donne? Storicamente, la filosofia ha offerto una caratterizzazione negativa del femminile e, propagando la convinzione che la razionalità fosse una prerogativa maschile, ha contribuito a escludere le donne dalle pratiche scientifiche e dalla sfera conoscitiva. La filosofia è davvero una pratica che si addice solo agli uomini ed è unicamente espressione del punto di vista maschile? Qual è il rapporto tra conoscenza, corpo e genere? Quali problemi etici la questione della cura pone rispetto alla tutela dei diritti di alcune categorie sociali? È pensabile una divinità al femminile? Nel rispondere a queste e ad altre domande, l’autrice illustra come la filosofia e le nostre pratiche scientifiche possono non essere neutrali rispetto al genere ed emarginare alcuni soggetti." ;

Also reviewed are the effects of anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists, heparin, and other glycosaminoglycans on survival of patients with cancer. As new anticoagulants and targeted anticancer therapies are developed, we can expect the interactions between coagulation and tumor biology to be an evolving and productive area for breakthroughs in basic science and clinical applications." ;

The aim of this study is to compare the effects on intestinal healing of two different autologous plasma preparations: PRP and plasma rich in growth factors(PRGF).\nMethods: Six pigs were subjected to handsewn jejuno-jejunal anastomoses, and randomly assigned to two groups. In all animals two anastomosis served as controls. In group A, PRP was applied to the remaining 4 anastomosis, and in group B PRGF was applied to the remaining 4 anastomosis. PRP/PRGF were obtained after centrifugation of venous blood and then activated just before application. The intestinal edges were immerged into the activated preparation until it had completely gelled. The anastomosis was then completed. All animals were euthanased 8 days after. At necropsy adhesions, leakage, presence of granulomas at the anastomotic site were recorded. Bursting pressure was measured for each anastomosis and compared. Samples were submitted for histopathology to evaluate epithelialization, ulceration, inflammation, fibroplasia and neovascularization.\nResults\nThere was no evidence of leaking at anastomotic sites. Adhesions were more present on PRP samples. Bursting pressure was higher with PRGF but  not significantly. Histologically  no difference was found in the grade of inflammation, fibroplasia or neovascularization. Mucosal epithelialization was complete in a higher number of cases treated with PRGF compared to PRP and controls.\nConclusions\nIn the early phases of intestinal healing PRGF improves mucosal epithelialization while reducing mucosal ulceration in jejunal anastomosis in pigs." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Abstract\n\nThe first exon of the human androgen receptor (AR) contains a translated CAG (poly-glutamine) repeat. The repeat length is polymorphic in the normal population ranging from 8 to 35 repeats. Expansions to over 40 repeats lead to spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a late onset neurodegenerative disease. The repeat is located between the two parts of a bipartite amino-terminal transactivation function and the repeat length, also within in the normal range, is inversely correlated to the transactivation power of the receptor. P160 type co-activators bind more strongly to shorter repeats. A correlation between AR CAG repeat length and total risk, age at diagnosis, recurrence after surgery and aggressive growth has been reported for tumors of classical androgen target tissues. In the prostate, where androgens exert a mitogenic effect, the cancer risk increases with decreasing AR-CAG repeat length. In contrast, in the breast, where the hormone probably acts as anti-mitogen, a higher risk and earlier onset of breast cancer has been reported for carriers of BRCA1 mutations who also have long CAG repeats in the receptor gene. Somatic alterations during carcinogenesis appear to be frequent in endometrial and in colon cancer. In the endometrium the AR CAG repeat prevalently undergoes expansions consistent with the putative protective function of androgens in this tissue. Frequent repeat reductions during colon carcinogenesis would be consistent with a mitogenic effect of androgens. Analysis of AR protein expression by Western blot reveals expression of the AR in healthy and neoplastic colon tissues. Normal mucosa of the colon expresses both AR-isoforms of 110 and 87 kDa, while the tumor samples have lost the expression of the 110-kDa isoform. The 87-kDa isoform is devoid of the amino-terminal portion of the receptor molecule that also contains the poly-glutamine tract. The temporal and causal relation between isoform switch and somatic repeat reductions during colon carcinogenesis is as yet unclear, but the two events could both enhance p160 mediated androgen signaling. The recent finding that smad3 interacts with the AR in a way similar to p160 links the AR to TGFbeta signaling. Interruption of this signaling pathway is a frequent event in colon carcinogenesis." ;

Seven patients with intra- and extrahepatic bile duct stones were treated with this new technique. Complete resolution was observed in 4/7 cases. The water jet allows the mobilization of even the biggest stones and the elimination of stone debris, as well as the removing of fibrin and necrotic tissue fragments tightly attached to bile duct walls in subacute cholangitis." ;

A GCM autonomic component is a component exploiting two levels of adaptivity: i) a passive level, in which autonomic operations \nare provided as a set of limited and well-deﬁned primitives; ii) an active level, in which the adaptive behaviour of the component is leaded by a manager who takes care of planning and \ntaking adaptive decisions. The current deliverable is intended to be a tutorial concerning the step-by-step usage of \nthe second year prototype version of a GCM autonomic components implementation we have developed in the GridCOMP pro ject context, focusing on behavioural skeleton. Behavioural \nskeletons abstract component self-management in component-based design as design patterns abstract class design in classic OO development. Thus, behavioural skeleton describe recurring \npatterns of component assemblies that can be equipped with current and eﬀective management strategies (as the ones deﬁned in D.NFCF.03 to which this document is related) with respect to \na given management goal provided as a Quality of Service (QoS) contract.

        dcterms:abstract            "Since 1986, Klein pinpointed the 'embedding problem' among the main tasks L2 learners have to cope with in L2 speaking, the term referring to the need of linking the semantic content of a sentence to the information already available in the ongoing discourse. Research in L2 acquisition has shown that, even when the lexical and morphosyntactic structures needed to express specific information configurations are in place, learners can still lack the ability to use them in the ongoing discourse according to target language preferences, thus sticking to their source language preferences (Carroll & Lambert 2003, Dimroth & Lambert 2008, Lambert, Carroll & von Stutterheim 2008). Use of additive particles can pose similar 'embedding' problems, as they typically occur in a peculiar, non-canonical information configuration, in which a given predicate – available in the ongoing discourse – is claimed to hold for a new referent, which is added to other – given, available – referents. Dimroth et al. (2010), comparing native speakers productions on the basis of the same narrative task (the Finite Story retelling), show that speakers of Germanic (Dutch, German) and Romance (French, Italian) languages differ in the way they embed additive particles in the sentence information structure. Our study focuses on the use of additive particles by intermediate learners of two language pairs (Italian L1 > German L2 and viceversa) in the Finite Story retelling. Results show that, in embedding additive particles (IT anche, GE auch) in the sentence structure, intermediate learners tend to adopt patterns that are compatible with the L1 both at positional and at prosodic level, thus partly discarding more target language-specific patterns." ;

Accordingly, an additional defect in bilirubin transport might be required for phenotypic expression. Plasma bilirubin and the early fractional hepatic uptake rate (BSP K(1)) of a low dose of tetrabromosulfophthalein (0.59 micromol/kg) were determined in (1) 15 unrelated patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia plus 12 random controls; (2) 4 unrelated GS probands and 15 of their first-degree relatives; (3) 7 unrelated patients with hemolysis due to beta-Thalassemia minor. Subjects were classified by DNA sequencing of the promoter region of both UGT1A1 alleles. In group 1, GS homozygotes showed a highly significant negative linear correlation between plasma bilirubin levels and BSP K(1). BSP K(1) values overlapped considerably between GS and normal subjects, whereas, in group 2, they were clustered within, and sharply segregated among, families. Patients with hemolysis, despite elevated plasma bilirubin levels, had mean BSP K(1) values similar to the normal subjects. Within each GS subgroup with defined UGT1A1 mutations, the plasma bilirubin level is in part determined by the organic anion uptake rate, assessed by early plasma disappearance of low-dose BSP. The lower BSP uptake in GS is not secondary to the hyperbilirubinemia, but probably caused by (an) independent, genetically determined defect(s) in hepatic transport mechanism(s), shared by BSP and bilirubin, that are likely necessary for phenotypic expression of GS." ;

This abuse does not involve physical infliction ofpain, but exposes nevertheless, the individuals to harm.This presentation will impact the forensic science communitydemonstrating how a disability predisposes sufferers to dental neglectalthough preventive dentistry and appropriate diet greatly contribute tobetter oral health.The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry has defined dentalneglect as the “willful failure of the parent or guardian to seek andfollow through with treatment necessary to ensure a level of oral healthessential for adequate function and freedom from pain and infection.”Dental caries, periodontal diseases, and other oral conditions leftuntreated in children will have a negative effect on nutrition and facialgrowth. Dental neglect can be observed in the disabled in children andadults with severe physical or mental disorders where personal hygieneis the responsibility of the parents or guardians. In these individuals theseverity of the disability often results in the inability of autonomous oralcare. Parents and/or guardians should assist any the personal hygienewhich these individuals are not able to conduct alone, including brushingteeth and appropriate diet.To ascertain the association between patients with disabilities anddental neglect a population study of 70 patients with severe disabilitieswere observed. Dentists and dental hygienists, with the collaboration ofnurses and psychologists, visited these individuals in a rehabilitationcentre in Noicattaro (Bari) where they spend the day on educational andrehabilitation programs. The goal of the oral examination was to assessthe condition of teeth and oral soft tissue. Parents and/or guardians werealso interviewed in order to register and evaluate cultural andpsychosocial backgrounds, together with knowledge of oral hygiene andtooth brushing regimes.The results of the clinical observations showed an associationbetween disability and dental neglect. There is evidence that having adisability predisposes sufferers to dental neglect although preventivedentistry and appropriate diet greatly contribute to better oral health.Cultural attitudes and poor knowledge of basic oral hygiene appear to beassociated with dental neglect, but also insufficient provision of dentalservices specifically tailored to disabled patients’ needs. Manycaregivers neglect their oral health themselves, visiting a dental officeonly when in pain for emergency treatment. The Italian National HealthSystem provides free dental care to patients with disabilities but fewdental clinics are adequately equipped for disabled patients. Alsocommunity dentistry is given a low priority and there seems to beinsufficient prevention and educational programs on these issues.It is the opinion that child dental neglect is an underestimatedphenomena and that oral health professionals should increase theirknowledge of community dentistry and child maltreatment. Finallyfamilies should receive specific oral hygiene instructions tailored tothose with disabilities." ;

L’Italia, in particolare, mostra di aver recepito con entusiasmo le novità provenienti d’Oltralpe, accogliendo in gran copia la terminologia gastronomica francese, sentita più suggestiva e di fatto divenuta ineludibile, in quanto riconosciuta come nucleo fondante del lessico tecnico del settore.\nLa nuova ondata francesizzante che si registra in Italia a partire dal Seicento trova un tramite naturale nella corte sabauda, grazie alla presenza delle due Madame Reali, Maria Cristiana di Borbone e Maria Giovanna Battista di Savoia Nemours, ideali mediatrici della cultura e dei costumi di Francia in Piemonte. Lo spoglio della documentazione d’archivio in lingua italiana legata alla casa ducale permette il recupero di un congruo numero di francesismi di ambito gastronomico, significativi per valutare l’introduzione e il radicamento delle nuove forme lessicali nell’uso linguistico del Piemonte. Diversamente dall’ampia serie di prestiti che si riscontreranno nel secolo successivo nei numerosi manuali di cucina mutuati dai modelli dei grandi cuochi d’Oltralpe (primi tra tutti Il Cuoco Piemontese e Il Confetturiere piemontese), le attestazioni documentarie evidenziano la reale diffusione dei francesismi nell’uso comune. Le voci nuove, che fanno la loro comparsa nei documenti della corte, ritornano infatti nei registri di conti e negli inventari di beni\npubblici e privati, confermando l’effettiva circolazione dei termini nell’italiano del Piemonte. La prossimità linguistica e culturale dei territori al di là e al di qua delle Alpi favorisce la precoce acquisizione di voci che solo successivamente si diffonderanno nella penisola; il recupero delle attestazioni ricavate dai documenti piemontesi consente di ricostruire con maggiore dettaglio e profondità prospettica il percorso di irradiazione delle diverse forme lessicali, la cui introduzione è anche il segno di un’evoluzione delle forme del gusto." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) and correlated Oral Preneoplastic Lesion (OPL) currently lack any effective therapeutic approach. In the last decade, many plant-based agents are recognized to exert their anticarcinogenic effects with promising results, but most of them were not able to confirm their antineoplastic activity in vivo for unfavorable phamacokinetic properties. Among these, one of the most studied is resveratrol (3,4’,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) (RV), a molecule produced by plants and found in appreciable amount in a variety of edible fruits including grape skin. RV has shown strong antineoplastic activities in many neoplastic cell lines interfering with more then one hundred pathways but, although serious adverse events are not observed after its systemic administration, it is metabolized very quickly and extensively in the body leading to an irrelevant in vivo effect compared to its remarkable in vitro efficacy. \nThe aim of our work was to test the efficacy of RV-based formulation on OLP and OSCC: to circumvent its degradation and to obtain locally sufficient therapeutic concentration with an improve of half-life, we perform our sperimentation by (i) RV topical administration on oral mucosa (an attractive alternative way for the easy accessibility of the anatomical site) (ii) inclusion of RV in a water-soluble cyclodextrin derivative (hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) able to form complexes with a wide variety of guest molecules. The experiment was carried out checking differences between two HPβCD based preparations, one dispersed in oil/water emulsion (to obtain a cream disposable only in well defined area) (CR) and one dissolved in phisiological solution (to mimic mouthwash administration) (MR), compared with RV simply dissolved in ethanol (ER). The preclinical sperimentation was performed both in vitro on hamster chemically-induced OSCC cell line (HCPC-I) and in vivo on the related animal model (DMBA induced OSCC in Syrian Hamsters buccal pouches, that reflects many aspects of human oral cancer progression) to test our formulations’ efficacy.\nObtained results in vitro and in vivo have shown lack of toxicity of both vehicles alone and formulations containing RV. Regarding in vitro efficacy, when RV was complexed in HPβCD, requested time and concentration were earlier and lower if compared with ethanol data. Also the significative growth inhibition was generally improved in HPβCD-formulations. About in vivo experiments, RV-HPβCD treated animal samples have shown significant differences regarding all considerate parameters: in particular a retard in the appearance of lesions, a three fold minor number of lesions for animal (prevalence) and diameter. The strongest action was found in MR group, whereas ER treatment was less effective and durable. CR group demonstrated an intermediate behaviour. Histological analysis confirmed the antineoplastic activity of RV not only for considerate end-points but also for its capability to mitigate histological signs of malignancy in animals buccal pouches lesions. \nThis study indicates that topical chemoprevention with RV included in HPβCD is a promising and realistic approach to perform translational clinical study.

The study focused on a set of floristic (endemics), structural (life forms) and ecological (thermic vegetation indicator) variables. Vegetation data were collected according to the GLORIA multi-summit standardized method during the last decade. The re-visitation revealed a moderate decrease in regional endemic flora and significant variations in structural and ecological parameters. The increase in caespitose hemicryptophytes in both sites, in suffruticose chamaephytes in the central Apennines and in rosette-forming hemicryptophytes in the southwestern Alps emerged, highlighting the rapid responses of the alpine vegetation to climate warming. The increase in perennial life forms is related with the expansion of graminoids and small woody plants. These life forms seem to be most suitable to face climate warming in Italian summits. The increase in the thermic vegetation indicator exceeds the mean European summits increment, and this is due to the expansion of thermophilic species. Short-term analyses with fine spatial and temporal resolutions are still necessary to improve our understanding concerning species behaviour in high-elevation ecosystems." ;

Internationalliterature reports that this crime is often associated with psychiatric morbidityand is usually committed by males. Patricide committed by sons is the mostfrequent form. In Italy, parricide is quite rare and it represents less than 3%of all murders (59% matricides and 41% patricides). The typical profile ofthe offender is a young adult male who is single and unemployed. Theoffender typically lives with victim (quite often an old and disabled person),and is suffering from mental illness with co-morbidity of alcohol or drugconsumption and/or abuse. Usually he is not able to separate himself fromhis parents or to assume responsibilities. The homicide usually takes place athome at the end of an argument, and common tools found in the house areoften used as weapons. A 73-year-old man was found dead at home, on thekitchen floor, after his son confessed the murder. He killed his father early inthe morning, after yet another argument with him. He then called the police,and sat on the floor awaiting the officers, fully aware of his guilt. A pair ofscissors and a cross-head screwdriver, both with traces of blood, and awooden board were located close to the body. At crime scene, the victim wassupine and showed multiple injury pattern. Clothes were raised upon thethorax and multiple thoracic-abdominal lesions were found together withbruises and abrasions of the head. The sternal area showed two larger stabwounds, while eleven penetrating cross-shaped puncture wounds affectedprecordial, epigastric, and mesogastric regions. Four other shallow, crossshapedpunctures of the skin surrounded these lesions. At autopsy, grossexamination of organs showed visceral lesions with cardiac, hepatic, andintestinal involvement, widespread hemorrhagic infiltrates of cranial softtissues, skull fractures (vault), and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH).Multiple and serial rib fractures were also found. The cause of death wasrelated to traumatic shock due to blunt head trauma and multiple stab wounds. All autopsy data allowed drawing the following crimereconstruction: victim’s head was initially hit with the wooden board and the man fell down, striking his head on the floor. Then the offender uncovered the anterior thorax and abdominal anatomical regions of his father andstabbed him with the pair of scissors and the screwdriver. Finally, he raised the victim’s body, crushing the chest with his weight. The offender’s criminal profile revealed a 45-year-old man, with elementary school education. At a young age, he became a construction worker at building sites in NorthernItaly. The father, a construction worker too, was described as extremely strictwith the son. The mother, a housewife, was characterized as a warm-hearted woman. The offender was very shy, the second of six children, and the only son. He did not have any recent romantic interests and he remembered onlyoone relationship with a woman in the past. No psychiatric disorders were inhis medical records. He had a history of drug-addiction (intravenous heroin) and during the last years, he admitted to occasional use of cannabinoids and cocaine sniffing. However, the drug screen was negative when he was imprisoned. His mother had died a few months before, and due to an accidentat work, the offender had lost his job.

        dcterms:abstract            "As grain production becomes more vital and the constraints of climate change grip tighter on the farming systems worldwide, the improvement of efficiencies, the reduction of costs and the optimum allocation of resources is becoming even more important to the farmer. Australia has many unique grain growing areas, where production is carried out under very marginal growing conditions and it is often the scale of farms that makes them profitable. A discrete event simulation was built upon the data collected during field trials to model some typical southern Australian harvesting systems and was compared to actual data collected in the field during harvesting. Simulation parameters included: combine size, operating speed, turning time, unloading time and overall work rate efficiency. Field shape, size and location of temporary storage (field bins) along with the travel distance to the grain silo where recorded and monitored and investigated in a case study. The model was able to optimize the harvest pattern, the number and location of field bins and the number of road transport trucks to best match the harvester and grain transport. Example benefits for a 5000 ha wheat farm included a reduction of 9.5% in harvesting time and a fuel saving of 2100 kg (equivalent to 5.8 t.year -1 reduction in CO2 emissions). The validated model will form part of a decision support tool that farmers can use to optimize their investment patterns for the complete harvest system. This tool aims to minimise production costs, maximise harvested yield and cropping income, in a strategy to reduce farming risks and improve sustainability." ;

Mann’s cautions are even stranger, when we consider the battle he fought during the Twenties against philosophical irrationalism, the very fertile ground for the Nazi movement. In the years between 1933 and 1936 Voyage with Don Quixote (1934) is one of the very few interventions which contains  traces of polemic against Nazi regime. The journalistic report of his first transoceanic voyage, at first sight heedless and frivolous, has in it a precise rethoric strategy, wich is used by Mann to outflank censorship and keep in touch with his german public.

A causa del volume di lavoro e dei tempi di esecuzione richiesti, l’interpretazione simultanea rappresenta l’unica modalità d’interpretariato impiegata non solo al Parlamento, ma in tutti gli organi istituzionali comunitari, per preservare il multilinguismo e dare la possibilità ad ogni cittadino di essere informato e ascoltato nella propria lingua. In accordo con il principio secondo cui le istituzioni europee garantiscono la trasparenza del proprio operato, gli interventi del Parlamento Europeo vengono verbalizzati e resi pubblici in tutte le lingue comunitarie. Le traduzioni vengono redatte sulla base delle verbalizzazioni ufficiali che, pur rispettando fedelmente i discorsi orali, non riportano tuttavia gli elementi tipici del parlato né gli elementi prosodici e paraverbali come pause, esitazioni e ripetizioni. Le interpretazioni invece vengono realizzate simultaneamente agli interventi dei parlamentari ma, non avendo valore giuridico, sono disponibili sul sito esclusivamente sotto forma di file audio e non di testo. \nIl corpus utilizzato per questo lavoro è costituito da 10 brevi interventi pronunciati tra il 2009 e il 2011 durante diverse sessioni plenarie da sei deputate tedescofone (tedesche e austriache) in materia di pari opportunità e di diritti delle donne e dalle relative interpretazioni simultanee in lingua italiana.  Per l’analisi delle stesse e il confronto con gli interventi in originale, la cui durata varia dal minuto al minuto e mezzo, si è dovuto procedere ad una trascrizione dei discorsi, per la quale tuttavia non si è ricorsi ad alcun sistema di trascrizione fonetica, dal momento che quest’ultimo avrebbe reso sicuramente più faticoso il confronto con le trascrizioni ufficiali." ;

The subjects were divided into two groups of six athletes: 1) the experimental group (EG) in addiction of tennis training on field, following eight weeks (WKs) of weightlifting training; 2) the control group (CG) do not change their tennis training habits. At the beginning of the research EG performed four WKs of weightlifting training to avoid that the learning effect worse the technique of exercises used in training protocols. At the end of four weeks of training, the weightlifting training protocol began. All groups were evaluated before and after two months of training to verify the effects of weightlifting and tennis training. The isometric MVC was measured using the TESYS system (Total Evaluation System, Globus, Treviso, Italy) which was connected to a load cell (ESYCC300, Globus Italy, Treviso, Italy).\n\nRESULTS\nData analysis (Wilcoxon test) showed a significant increase in MVC in EG in the NR (p<0.05, +16%) and R conditions (p<0.05, +11%). No significant changes were observed in CG.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe weightlifting training increases the isometric MVC of NR and R, while playing only tennis is sufficient to maintain strength performance. The results highlight that training with overloads can significantly contribute to improve physical efficiency on upper body in wheelchair tennis athletes and so facilitate them to become more dangerous to opponents." ;

Although widely accepted and investigated, ACL reconstruction still continues to evolve and many technical issues are under debate. They mainly include: 1) graft selection, 2) surgical technique (double versus single bundle) and 3) femoral tunnel drilling in single bundle ACL reconstruction. In this review, the authors describe the indications, surgical technique and results of anatomic ACL reconstruction. The controversies are also discussed, through a recent literature review.\n\nMethodology\n\nAfter an ACL tear, three possible treatment options are available: 1) conservative treatment, 2) acute ACL reconstruction (within the first six weeks) and 3) chronic reconstruction. Patient’s age, profession and activity level need to be carefully evaluated to correctly plan the treatment.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo achieve good results and high satisfaction rates, correct treatment has to be tailored to meet the patient’s needs, profession, activity level, age and sports. Considering the literature review, many issues regarding ACL reconstruction are still under debate and need to be clarified with high quality studies." ;

La motivazione umana è legata al modo in cui le persone introiettano norme e valori e di come questi si modifichino nel tempo\t influenzando l’agire\t umano (Marcia, 1980). Gli individui tuttavia sembrano dimostrare livelli qualitativamente\t diversi di regolazione del comportamento (Losier et al.,\t 2001).

        dcterms:abstract            "The inflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) is known to trigger invasive growth, a physiological property for tissue healing, turning into a hallmark of progression in cancer. However, the invasive response to TNF-α relies on poorly understood molecular mechanisms. We thus investigated whether it involves the MET oncogene, which regulates the invasive growth program by encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor for Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). Here we show that the TNF-α pro-invasive activity requires MET function, as it is fully inhibited by MET-specific inhibitors (small-molecules, antibodies, and siRNAs). Mechanistically, we show that TNF-α induces MET transcription via NF-κB, and exploits MET to sustain MEK/ERK activation and Snail accumulation, leading to E-cadherin downregulation. We then show that TNF-α not only induces MET expression in cancer cells, but also HGF secretion by fibroblasts. Consistently, we found that, in human colorectal cancer tissues, high levels of TNF-α correlates with increased expression of both MET and HGF. These findings suggest that TNF-α fosters a HGF/MET pro-invasive paracrine loop in tumors. Targeting this ligand/receptor pair would contribute to prevent cancer progression associated with inflammation." ;

Lymphocytes were the predominant cell type, in pleural fluid, in neoplastic pleural effusions as well as in congestive heart failure pleural effusions and, especially, in tuberculous pleural effusions. Lymphocyte analysis in pleural fluid and in peripheral blood suggests the involvement of different mechanisms for the lymphocyte accumulation in the pleural space according to different etiologies. Tuberculous pleural effusions showed an evident CD4+ and TEC T5.9+ lymphocyte accumulation from peripheral blood. In these patients, cutaneous skin test response to purified protein derivative was strongly related to this situation. In neoplastic pleural effusions there was a lower percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes, reflecting circulating lymphocyte pool; however, in neoplastic pleural effusions, various lymphocyte patterns may be sometimes observed depending on different histologies.

In this study we aimed to show that a sensomotoric babysitter-procedure after median nerve injury is capable of preserving irreversible muscular atrophy. The median nerve of 20 female Wistar rats was denervated. 10 animals received a sensory protection with the N. cutaneous brachii. After six weeks the median nerve was reconstructed by autologous nerve grafting from the contralateral median nerve in the babysitter and the control groups. Grasping tests measured functional recovery over 15 weeks. At the end of the observation period the weight of the flexor digitorum sublimis muscle was determined. The median nerve was excised for histological examinations. Muscle weight ( ) was significantly superior in the babysitter group compared to the control group at the end of the study. The histological evaluation revealed a significantly higher diameter of axons ( ), nerve fiber ( ), and nerve surface ( ) in the babysitter group. We conclude that sensory protection of a motor nerve is capable of preserving muscule weight and we may presume that metabolism of the sensory nerve was sufficient to keep the target muscle’s weight and vitality." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Cholesteryl butyrate solid lipid nanoparticles (cholbut SLN) can be a delivery system [1] for the anti-cancer drug butyrate. We have previously shown that cholbut SLN inhibit the adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and suggested that they may act as an anti-inflammatory agent [2]. Moreover, cholbut SLN inhibited HUVEC adhesiveness to cancer cell lines derived from human colon–rectum, breast, prostate cancers and melanoma. The effect was concentration and time-dependent and exerted on both cancer cells and HUVEC. In addition, these SLN inhibited migration of cancer cells and substantially down-modulated ERK and p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, cholbut SLN induced E-cadherin and inhibited claudin-1 expression in HUVEC [3]. The aim of the research reported here was to evaluate the activity of cholbut SLN on tumor cell growth using in vitro and in vivo models. We demonstrated, using the MTT test, that cholbut SLN strikingly decreased viability of the colon cancer cell lines HT29, HCT15, and HCT116, and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. The effect was concentration and time-dependent and exerted on all tumor cell lines, being HCT15, HT29 and PC-3 only minimally sensitive to the free butyrate. The cholbut SLN inhibition detected by the clonogenic assay was consistently higher than that detected by the MTT assay, suggesting that several cells, that were still viable after the cholbut SLN treatment in the MTT assay, were severely damaged since they were unable to proliferate in the clonogenic assay. These effects seemed to be mediated by inhibition of the Akt pathway since cholbut SLN substantially down-modulated Akt phosphorylation on all cell lines and, in PC-3 cells, induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phases. To assess the effect of cholbut SLN in vivo, mice were injected i.v. with 1x106 PC3-Luc cells and treated with cholbut SLN or PBS. At time 0, and 7, 14, and 21 days after cell injection, mice were i.p. injected with luciferin and analyzed by in vivo optical imaging to evaluate the tumor cell growth in the lungs. Qualitative and quantitative analyses showed that a progressively increasing luminescent signal was present in the lungs of control mice, while no signal was detected in the lungs of mice treated with cholbut SLN. Histological analysis showed that no metastases were detected in the lungs of the mice treated with cholbut SLN, while disseminated tumor foci were detected in the lungs of the control mice. To further assess the cholbut SLN effect on the tumor growth in vivo, mice were injected s.c. with PC-3 cells and treated with either cholbut SLN or PBS starting when the tumor diameter reached 2 mm. Analysis of the tumor dimension showed that treatment with cholbut SLN substantially delayed the tumor growth compared to that detected in the control mice. These results suggest that cholbut SLN may act as an anti-metastastic drug, and they add a novel mechanism to the anti-tumour activity of this multifaceted drug." ;

In order to assess the possible risk of chromosomal abnormalities in germ cells of domestic animals we investigated the aneuploidy rates on partially decondensed sperm and in vitro matured oocytes in two cattle breeds, Italian Friesian (I.F.) and Italian Brown (I.B.), by using FISH with chromosome-specific painting probes (chromosomes X-Y for sperm and chromosomes X-5 for oocytes). For each bull, more than 5,000 sperm were analyzed, for a total of 52,586 and 51,342 sperm cells for the two breeds, respectively. Aneuploid and diploid sperm had, respectively, a frequency of 0.110% and 0.050% in the I.F. and 0.078% and 0.062% in the I.B. breeds. Out of 100 in vitro matured oocytes for each breed, on the average, diploidy affected 11.2% and 18.4% in the I.F. and I.B., respectively, whereas disomy for chromosome X-had a frequency of 2% in the I.F. and 2.5% in the I.B. breeds. Further studies are needed to expand our knowledge on frequency of aneuploidy in sperm and oocytes of domestic animals, in order to assess their impact on productive and reproductive efficiency, also in relation to climatic changes and environmental hazards." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Currently several Grid Research initiatives are on-going or planned at national and European Community level. These initiatives propose the development of a rich set of advanced technologies, methodologies and applications, however enhanced co-ordination amongst the funding bodies is required to achieve critical mass, avoid duplication and reduce fragmentation in order to solve the challenges ahead. In the 2002 – 2006 timeframe, the funding for Grid research and deployment at EU level more than doubled passing from FP5 to FP6 reaching the amount of 275 M€. During the same period, an estimate of the funding for Grid research and deployment by Member and Accession States (UK, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, Sweden) is about 300-500 M€. The totality of these initiatives could provide the EU with the potential to play a world leadership role in Grid technologies and applications. National and EU collaborations have been established with other international players (in the US and Asia-Pacific) and with international standards organisations. However, if Europe wishes to compete with leading global players, it would be sensible to attempt to better coordinate its various, fragmented efforts towards achieving critical mass and the potential for a more visible impact at an international level. Achieving such a coordinated approach will require:\n\n- Co-ordination among the funding authorities in order to maximise the effective use of the considerable resources;\n- Collaboration amongst the individual researchers; the creation of European excellence and competence centres\n- A visionary research agenda.\n\nThe first objective of this proposal is to strengthen co-operation amongst the funding authorities in order to better co-ordinate the planning of future activities in the field of Grid research, an ERA objective. A second objective is to enhance the already ongoing collaboration among the research actors and users. A third objective is to develop, based on the above, national and EU Programme visions and roadmaps enabling Europe to play a leadership role in Grid technologies and applications." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "From 1997 to 2003, Italy has been affected by two epidemics of highly pathogenic \navian influenza and by several outbreaks of low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). \nIn 1999-2000 a severe avian influenza (AI) epidemic affected the country. The \nepidemic was caused by a type-A influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype, originated \nfrom a low-pathogenic (LP) AI virus, which spread in 1999 among poultry farms in \nNortheastern Italy and eventually became virulent by mutation with the emergence of \na highly pathogenic (HP) strain. From 17 December 1999 to 5 April 2000, a total of \n413 outbreaks (178 meat-type turkey, 5 turkey breeder, 29 broiler breeder, 119 layer, \n37 broiler, 9 guinea fowl, 11 game farm and 25 back-yard flocks) were identified and \nthe last affected flock was stamped out on 5 April 2000. A total of about 16 million \nbirds died or were stamped out on affected and at-risk premises. \nFrom August 2000 to March 2001 in two epidemic waves, the H7N1 LPAI strain \ninfected 73 turkey farms, which housed 1 million turkeys, 4 quail farms, with about \n800,000 quails, and 1 layer farm (40,000 layers) located in the southwestern part of \nthe Veneto Region (Verona and Padua provinces). To supplement disease-control \nmeasures already in force an emergency vaccination programme was implemented \nbased on the ‘DIVA’ (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) strategy. After \nthe implementation of the vaccination programme, only 3 meat-type turkey farms \nwere infected inside the vaccination area and among these, only one vaccinated flock \nwas affected. The last affected flock was stamped out on 26 March 2001. \nIn October 2002, another LPAI virus of the H7N3 subtype emerged in the northern \npart of the country. The H7N3 LPAI strain rapidly spread among poultry flocks \nlocated in the densely populated poultry area (DPPA) which had been affected by the \nH7N1 epidemic in 1999-2001. Eradication measures were based on stamping out or \ncontrolled marketing of slaughterbirds on infected farms and on the prohibition of \nrestocking of poultry farms. Restriction measures on the movement of live poultry, \nvehicles and staff were also imposed in the areas at risk. To supplement diseasecontrol measures already in force, an emergency vaccination programme, based once \nagain on the ‘DIVA’ strategy was drawn, approved by the EU Commission and implemented in the area. From 10 October 2002 to 10 October 2003, the H7N3 LPAI \nvirus was able to spread and infect a total of 387 poultry holdings, mainly meat-type \nturkey farms; of these 88 were vaccinated. The implementation of a vaccination \nprogramme and the enforcement of strict restriction measures did not avoid the spread \nof the H7N3 LPAI virus infection among meat-turkey farms located in a DPPA. \nNevertheless, it was possible to prevent the massive spread of infection to poultry \nfarms other than turkey and to neighbouring vaccinated areas." ;

Epidemiological studies conducted on different populations consistently showed that consumption of alcoholic beverages is associated with cytogenetic damages and higher risk for several types of cancer. However, the interpretation of many cytogenetic studies resulted complicated because some confounding factors, such as smoking habit, are not always taken into account. In the present study, the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), chromosome aberrations (CAs) and micronuclei (MNs) in cultured human lymphocytes was assessed on 15 alcoholic and 15 non-alcoholic control male subjects. Moreover, considering the implication of the Glutathione S-transferases gene polymorphisms in the genetic susceptibility to alcoholic liver diseases, we considered an important issue to evaluate the relationship between these gene polymorphisms and the cytogenetic damage. In our sample we exclusively considered individuals that did not smoke nor consume drugs for a period of at least 2 years prior to the analysis. Statistically significant differences were found between alcoholics and controls in the frequency of SCEs/cell (P = 0.001), RI value (P = 0.001), CAs (P = 0.002) and CAB (P = 0.002). Vice versa, no significant differences were found between alcoholics and controls in terms of MNs frequency and CBPI value. In both samples, no statistically significant association was found between the analysed GSTs gene polymorphisms and the frequencies of MNs, SCEs and CAs. Finally, among alcoholics we found a positive correlation between SCEs and CAs frequencies and the duration of alcohol abuse." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "OBJECTIVE:\nThis study was done to assess breast density on digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis according to the visual Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classification, to compare visual assessment with Quantra software for automated density measurement, and to establish the role of the software in clinical practice.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\nWe analysed 200 digital mammograms performed in 2D and 3D modality, 100 of which positive for breast cancer and 100 negative. Radiological density was assessed with the BI-RADS classification; a Quantra density cut-off value was sought on the 2D images only to discriminate between BI-RADS categories 1-2 and BI-RADS 3-4. Breast density was correlated with age, use of hormone therapy, and increased risk of disease.\nRESULTS:\nThe agreement between the 2D and 3D assessments of BI-RADS density was high (K 0.96). A cut-off value of 21% is that which allows us to best discriminate between BI-RADS categories 1-2 and 3-4. Breast density was negatively correlated to age (r = -0.44) and positively to use of hormone therapy (p = 0.0004). Quantra density was higher in breasts with cancer than in healthy breasts.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThere is no clear difference between the visual assessments of density on 2D and 3D images. Use of the automated system requires the adoption of a cut-off value (set at 21%) to effectively discriminate BI-RADS 1-2 and 3-4, and could be useful in clinical practice." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "This paper studies the relationship between language and gender by focusing on the questions related to the naming of domestic violence against women, a social issue which emerged within—and thanks to—the feminist movement in the 1970s. The act of naming is understood, within the framework of a discursive and praxematic approach to the lexicon, as a linguistic act through which a social phenomenon is constructed and representations are conveyed both consciously and unconsciously. The data under investigation include a variety of texts representing feminist and institutional discourses (books and pamphlets from the 70s to the\npresent, articles from the press, sociology papers and documents published by international organizations such as the Council of Europe). Different expressions are used to name domestic violence, such as violence conjugale (conjugal violence), violence conjugale masculine (male conjugal violence), femme battue (battered woman), terrorisme patriarcal (patriarchal terrorism). These expressions are analyzed and evaluated in regard to their adequacy to name the social reality they\nare meant to describe. The analysis is carried out along two axes: the dichotomy of using a concrete name (femme battue) versus an abstract name (violence, terrorisme, maltraitance, torture, etc. + x) and that of using euphemisms rather than words and expressions that reveal a clearer stance against violence. The first axis also highlights the problem of naming the person subject to such violence in regards to the issues of victimhood and agency. The second axis brings to the forefront the way names can be used as an instrument of political action against violence. Especially highlighted are the ways institutionalized or juridical expressions such as violence conjugale lose their argumentative strength and their political appropriateness—phenomena denounced by feminist scholars." ;

The fiberscope permitted differentiation between different causes of biliary stenosis in the few cases where doubt persisted after percutaneous cholangiography. Brushing was also performed wherever necessary. The color, and thus the composition, of bile duct stones could also be determined. This has helped us to plan the therapy with methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) in patients with cholesterol stones. Compared with traditional fiberscopes (diameter of 5mm or more) the new instrument is easier to use, and allows more peripheral ducts to be reached, but is expensive and has a smaller field of view and fewer possibilities for therapeutic applications." ;

Effects of parity, calving season and month of production were also evaluated. Three SNPs were detected. The first mutation, located at position 89 of 17th exon (c.628C>T), is responsible for the amino acid change (p.Ser178Leu). The other two polymorphisms, detected at the positions 144 (c.882G>A) and 239 (c.977A>G) of 19th exon respectively, are silent (3’ UTR). \nAssociations between the CSN1S1 genotypes and milk production traits were investigated using 4,122 test day records of 503 lactations from 175 buffalo cows. Milk yield, fat and protein percentages were analyzed using a mixed linear model. A significant association between the c.628C>T SNP and the protein percentage was found. In particular, the CC genotype showed an average value of about 0.04% higher than the CT and TT genotypes. The allele substitution effect of the cytosine into the thymine was -0.014, with a quite low (0.3%) protein percentage (PP) contribution on total phenotypic variance. A large dominance effect was detected. \nFurthermore, a characterization of the CSN1S1 transcripts and a method based on MboI-ACRS-PCR for a rapid genotyping of c.628C>T were provided." ;

However, this sector differs widely in terms of environmental context, production targets, degree of intensification and cultural role. The traditional breeding systems in the Alps were largely based on the use of meadows and pastures and produce not only milk and meat but also other fundamental positive externalities and ecosystem services, such as the conservation of genetic resources, water flow regulation, pollination, climate regulation, landscape maintenance, recreation and ecotourism and cultural heritage. In recent decades, the mountain livestock, mainly represented by dairy cattle, have been affected by a dramatic reduction in the number of farms, a strong increase in the number of animals per farm, an increase in indoor production systems, more extensive use of specialised non-indigenous cattle breeds and the increasing use of extra-farm concentrates instead of meadows and pastures for fodder. The first section of this paper describes the livestock sector in the Italian Alps and analyses the most important factors affecting their sustainability. The second section discusses the need to assess the ecosystem services offered by forage-based livestock systems in mountains with particular attention to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and its mitigation by carbon sequestration. It is concluded that the comparison between the different elements of the environmental sustainability of mountain livestock systems must be based on a comprehensive overview of the relationships between animal husbandry, the environment and the socio-economic context." ;

Our aim in this paper is to introduce the ideas of Bergson and to show how these ideas shed light on mathematics classroom activity. Bergson’s monist philosophy provides a framework for understanding the materiality of both bodies and mathematical concepts. We discuss two case studies of classrooms to show how the mathematical concepts of number and function are themselves mobile and full of potentiality, open to deformation and the remapping of the (im)possible. Bergson helps us look differently at mathematical activity in the classroom, not as a closed set of distinct interacting bodies groping after abstract concepts, but as a dynamic relational assemblage." ;

We have reported previously that macrophages from Tyk2-deficient mice exhibit selective defects in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We demonstrate now, that LPS stimulation induces interleukin-17 (IL-17) production via a Tyk2-dependent pathway in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. IL-17 and IL-17F were upregulated upon LPS treatment with similar kinetics and both mRNAs were considerably reduced in the absence of Tyk2. Interestingly, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was not required for LPS-induced IL-17 production in macrophages. In the absence of STAT3, IL-17/IL-17F mRNA and IL-17 protein expression were strongly increased upon LPS treatment and, to a lower extend, produced constitutively. Thus, in contrast to its essential role in the differentiation/maintenance of IL-17 producing T cells (Th17), STAT3 exerts inhibitory rather than stimulatory effects on LPS-induced IL-17 production in macrophages. Of note, we also prove that Tyk2 is indispensable for IL-17 production following LPS challenge in vivo. We could exclude mature T cells as main source of IL-17 in spleens following intraperitoneal administration of LPS. Currently, we are investigating the contribution of Tyk2 to innate IL-17 production in specific cell types in vivo." ;

The main disadvantage of the free growth factors is their short half-life of few minutes. In order to prolong their activity, we have conjugated to iron oxide nanoparticles three neurotrophic factors: nerve growth factor (βNGF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). Comparative stability studies of free versus conjugated factors revealed that the conjugated neurotrophic factors were significantly more stable in tissue cultures and in medium at 37°C. The biological effects of free versus conjugated neurotrophic factors were examined on organotypic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cultures performed in NVR-Gel, composed mainly of hyaluronic acid and laminin. Results revealed that the conjugated neurotrophic factors enhanced early nerve fiber sprouting compared to the corresponding free factors. The most meaningful result was that conjugated-GDNF, accelerated the onset and progression of myelin significantly earlier than the free GDNF and the other free and conjugated factors. This is probably due to the beneficial and long-acting effect that the stabilized conjugated-GDNF had on neurons and Schwann cells. These conclusive results make NVR-Gel enriched with conjugated-GDNF, a desirable scaffold for the reconstruction of severed peripheral nerve." ;

Hybrid chitosan have shown promising effect on fibrosis prevention. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of chitosan-silane membrane on the lumbar surgery scarring process. These membranes have improved mechanical strength which makes them suitable to maintain a predefined shape. Methods: A two level lumbar laminectomy was performed in 14 New Zealand male rabbits. Laminectomy sites were randomly selected for biomaterial or control. Chitosan membranes were prepared and care was taken in order to make it adapted to the bone defect dimensions covering the totality of the defect including the bone margins. Histological analysis was performed by haematoxylin/eosin and by Masson's trichrome staining four weeks after laminectomy. Results: Microscope observations revealed the presence of a well-organized regenerating tissue, integrated in the surrounding vertebral bone tissue with a regular and all-site interface on the chitosan sites, in clear contrast with the presence of a disorganized regenerating tissue with aspects consistent with the persistence of a chronic inflammatory condition, on control sites. Discussion: The results of this study clearly demonstrated that hybrid chitosan had an organizing effect on post-operative scarring process. The presence of the hybrid chitosan membrane resulted on a well-organized tissue integrated in the surrounding vertebral bone tissue with signs of regenerative bone tissue in continuity with native bone. This can be a major feature on the dynamics of epidural fibrosis formation." ;

ECs express B7h, which is the ligand of the ICOS T cell costimulatory molecule, and is also expressed by many cancer cell lines. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of B7h triggering by a soluble form of ICOS (ICOS-Fc) on the adhesion of cancer cell lines to EC using human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) and the HT29, HCT116, DLD1 and Caco-2 (colon carcinoma), RPMI7932, JR8, M14, PCF2 (melanoma), HMC-1 (mastocytoma), PC3 (prostate carcinoma), and Hep-G2 (liver carcinoma) cell lines. Results showed that ICOS-Fc inhibited adhesion at high levels (> 40%) in PC3, Hep-G2, and HMC-1; at intermediate levels (30-40%) in JR8 and RPMI7932; whereas the effect was not significant (<25%) in M14, CaCo-2, and PCF2. The effect was detectable as early as 30 min after treatment, was still present after 24 h, and was exerted on both HUVEC and the cancer cell lines expressing B7h. It was inhibited by soluble anti-ICOS reagents (mAb and B7h-Fc) and silencing of B7h on HUVECs, and it was not displayed by an F119S mutated form of ICOS-Fc that does not bind B7h. HUVEC treatment with ICOS-Fc did not modulate expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines, but it substantially downmodulated ERK phosphorylation induced by E-selectin triggering or osteopontin, which may influence HUVEC adhesiveness. Since cell migration uses adhesive mechanisms, we also assessed whether ICOS-Fc influences cell migration assessed in Boyden chamber assays using HUVEC and the cancer cell lines (HT29, HCT116, PC-3, RPMI7932, JR8, M14, PCF2 and LM). Results showed that ICOS-Fc substantially inhibited migration of both HUVECs and all the cancer cell lines except  RPMI7932, PCF2 and LM. Therefore, the B7h–ICOS interaction may modulate spreading of cancer metastases, which opens a view on the use of ICOS-Fc as an immunomodulatory drug." ;

In fact, the time of infury does not always correlate with the onset of symptoms, theretore causing a strong debate among the parties of the contract. The Authors report the history of a man who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and whose symptoms escalated a few months after the insurance policy was taken out, so the Company denied any benefits to him. Contractua terms are reviewed regarding the clause excluding the insurance benefits in the event of disability that was present before the insurance policy was signed.

Moreover, HUVEC treatment with ICOS-Fc also inhibited adhesion of polymorphonuclear cells and several tumor cell lines from different origins. Therefore, the B7h-ICOS interaction may modulate spreading of cancer metastases and recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells in inflammatory sites, which opens a view on the use of ICOS-Fc as an immunomodulatory drug." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Nelle zone montane, le tradizionali forme di allevamento per la produzione del latte e dei suoi derivati possono essere indubbiamente considerate a basso impatto ambientale: i sistemi zootecnici applicati rappresentano interessanti modelli  di integrazione sostenibile tra gestione delle superfici e processi produttivi. Le ragioni sono molteplici, ma in primo luogo si possono richiamare le favorevoli ricadute sull’ambiente legate al prevalente impiego di risorse foraggere locali. Anche le indicazioni comunitarie sono a favore di produzioni d’allevamento ottenute attraverso sistemi estensivi per il positivo effetto sul benessere degli animali allevati, per le ricadute in termini di mantenimento della biodiversità nonché per la qualità dei prodotti. \nLa filiera per la produzione di latte rappresenta, ancora oggi, una delle più gratificanti possibilità di mantenimento dell’attività umana in ambiente montano, fondamentale per il controllo e per la difesa di territori complessi e difficili; è necessario però che vengano opportunamente valorizzate, anche dal punto di vista economico, le proprietà qualitative della derrata  e dei suoi derivati.\nLo studio dei legami esistenti tra i sistemi zootecnici ad indirizzo lattiero-caseario a basso input e le componenti ambientali dei territori di montagna, grazie a strumenti di valutazione d’impatto ambientale  come il Life Cicle Assessment o LCA, mettono in evidenza l'importante ruolo che questi sistemi, basati sul pascolamento, svolgono nel mantenere il fragile e dinamico equilibrio ambientale di queste aree. Svariate ricerche indicano peraltro che l’acido linoleico coniugato (CLA) naturalmente presente nel latte e nei derivati caseari ottenuti nelle aziende pastorali, possiede importanti proprietà salutistiche.\nI sistemi di produzione lattiero-caseari di molti territori di montagna sono stati tuttavia oggetto di una crescente intensificazione delle tecniche,  influenzate dalle pratiche tipiche degli ambienti di pianura. Grazie all’impegno e alla determinazione di molti alpigiani, sono però ancora presenti sistemi produttivi che fanno esclusivo di foraggi locali, la cui reputazione e status deve essere convenientemente riconosciuta. Questo quadro “sociale” dovrebbe peraltro cambiare nel prossimo futuro a causa del forte calo di disponibilità di terreno coltivabile, dei processi di urbanizzazione e industrializzazione ed alla conseguente riscoperta delle risorse pastorali. La zootecnia di montagna dovrebbe essere perciò orientata verso l’uso sostenibile di queste superfici quale migliore destinazione d’uso del suolo; per realizzare ciò è necessario che venga pienamente compreso da un’opinione pubblica il più ampia possibile,  il valore etico di queste realtà produttive per consentirne anche un maggior riconoscimento del ruolo sociale. La filiera di produzione casearia delle aziende pastorali montane in grado di  consentire una appropriata trasformazione del foraggio naturale e spontaneo in derrate di elevato valore nutrizionale, in un contesto ecologico equilibrato e rinnovabile, rappresenta certamente un’espressione piena e sincera di “linguaggio” pulito di un alimento prezioso come il latte." ;

In particular the photocatalytic activity of the micro-sized sample was evaluated in comparison with the well-known activity of the nano-sized samples, being these last photocatalysts potentially dangerous due to the risk towards the human safety. The studied samples were precisely chosen among different commercially available products on the basis of the following features: pure anatase, uncoated surface, undoped material, not sold as photocatalytic materials. All samples reveal good photoactivity in the photodegradation of NOx in gas phase with an evident superiority of the nano-sized sample. However, the gap of activity between nano and micro-sized samples tends to be canceled when the starting NO2\nconcentration was reduced and fixed from 1000 to 200 ppb, a precise amount that is the first alert threshold for NO2 in air (World Health Organization). A proper kinetic model, based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood\nmechanism and on the hypothesis of irreversible adsorption of the products on the catalysts surface, has been developed and discussed." ;

Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults (age 74±6 years; 69% were women) living in Piemonte Region were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Socio-demographic and medical characteristics were captured by self-reported questionnaires. Physical frailty was assessed using the five criteria of Fried: shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity level. HRQOL was measured with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), using both the mental (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS). Among individual characteristics, gender was the best predictor for SF-36, the MCS, and the PCS, with values of R(2) of 12.7%, 12.1%, and 8.8%, respectively. Among the five Fried's criteria, poor endurance and energy had the largest effect on HRQOL with values of ΔR(2) of 13.9% for SF-36, 13.4% for the MCS, and 9.4% for the PCS. Results highlighted the role of the individual characteristics and the single weight of the five components of physical frailty on HRQOL. This knowledge may give new insights about the relations between individual functioning and self-rated health, allowing the development of individualized and more effective preventive interventions for a healthy aging." ;

La molecola più studiata nel DBP è l’olanzapina, che si è dimostrata efficace sui sintomi cognitivo-percettivi, sulla disregolazione affettiva e sul discontrollo degli impulsi. L’asenapina è un AA di recente introduzione, che è stato oggetto nel DBP di un singolo studio in aperto. L’obiettivo del trial è di confrontare efficacia e tollerabilità di asenapina e olanzapina in pazienti con DBP. Metodo: I pazienti sono stati randomizzati a uno dei bracci di trattamento: asenapina 5 mg x 2/die; olanzapina 10 mg/die. Sono stati valutati a T0, a 4 e 8 settimane con CGI-S, HAM-A, HAM-D, SOFAS, BPDSI, BIS-11, MOAS, SHI e DOTES. Risultati: I due farmaci hanno avuto un effetto significativo ed equivalente sui punteggi delle scale BPDSI, BIS 11, SHI, HAM-A e SOFAS. Gli effetti collaterali sono stati irrequietezza e ipoestesia orale nel gruppo con asenapina; sedazione e incremento ponderale in quello con olanzapina . Conclusioni: Non emergono differenze significative di efficacia sui sintomi del DBP, su impulsività, condotte autolesive, ansia e funzionamento sociale.

However, the percentage of children with elevated Lp(a) (85th percentile) was higher among those with a positive family history for early CVD (p=0.01). Lp(a) was a significant independent predictor of the number of premature cardiovascular events (β=0.17, p=0.01) and of cerebrovascular events in the kindreds (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.05-6.03, p=0.039), independent of plasma lipid fractions and other risk factors. Furthermore in the group of children showing only elevated Lp(a) levels a positive family history of CVD was detected in 85% families with an higher incidence of ischemic stroke alone or plus coronary heart disease (64.7%).\nConclusion: the association between Lp(a) and family history of early CVD is due to a threshold effect among those with the highest Lp(a) levels. Furthermore multiple cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events are significantly predicted by any increase in plasma Lp(a) levels, independent of other cardiovascular risk factors." ;

Is the PAYG quota really progressive? This is a crucial question, since in the affirmative case the transition to neutrality would imply a first round effect towards higher pension earnings inequality. The answer however is not obvious, since there are also several work career features affecting redistribution. Building on a baseline population made up of a long panel of work careers, that we simulate backward up to labour market entry and forward up to retirement end, we are able to show that, a bit surprisingly, the current system is regressive: it redistributes from poor to rich. A second evidence is the relevance of pension updating rules: although seldom discussed in the policy debate, they have a large role in the redistributive features of the system." ;

To shed light on this issue, we retrospectively examined a large series of PTC patients with and without positive TgAb. Methods: Data on 220 TgAb-positive PTC patients (study cohort) were retrospectively collected in 10 hospital-based referral centers. All the patients had undergone near-total thyroidectomy with or without radioiodine remnant ablation. Tumor characteristics and long-term outcomes (follow-up range: 2.5-24.8 years) were compared with those recently reported in 1020 TgAb-negative PTC patients with similar demographic characteristics. We also assessed the impact on clinical outcome of early titer disappearance in the TgAb-positive group. Results: At baseline, the study cohort (mean age 45.9 years, range 12.5-84.1 years; 85% female) had a significantly higher prevalence of high-risk patients (6.9% vs. 3.2%, p<0.05) and extrathyroidal tumor extension (28.2% vs. 24%; p<0.0001) than TgAb-negative controls. Study cohort patients were also more likely than controls to have persistent disease at the 1-year visit (13.6% vs. 7.0%, p=0.001) or recurrence during subsequent follow-up (5.8% vs. 1.4%, p=0.0001). At the final follow-up visit, the percentage of patients with either persistent or recurrent disease in the two cohorts was significantly different (6.4% of TgAb-positive patients vs. 1.7% in the TgAb-negative group, p<0.0001). At the 1-year visit, titer normalization was observed in 85 of the 220 TgAb-positive individuals. These patients had a significantly lower rate of persistent disease than those who were still TgAb positive (8.2% vs. 17.3%. p=0.05), and no relapses were observed among patients with no evidence of disease during subsequent follow-up. Conclusions: PTC patients with positive serum TgAb titer during the first year after primary treatment were more likely to have persistent/recurrent disease than those who were consistently TgAb-negative. Negative titers at 1 year may be associated with more favorable outcomes." ;

Risk factors, tissue and biological markers (MET proto-oncogene, S phase kinase-associated protein-Skp2) have also been taken into consideration as possible indicators of tumour aggressiveness and predictors of the carcinogenic process and metastatic capability.\nMethods: A total of 500 patients were studied who had undergone surgery for OSCC between 1989 and 2011. For each patient, personal data, alcohol and tobacco con- sumption, symptoms, histological findings, treatment and outcome were recorded and analyzed statistically. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier algorithm, and the difference in survival among subgroups was examined.\nThe role of S phase kinase-associated protein (Skp2) and of MET gene mutations was investigated in 71 and 12 patients respectively.\nResults : The differences in the 5-year survival were sig- nificant for the site of origin, N and pN status, TNM stage groups, grading, status of the resection margins, osseous infiltration, and perineural invasion. Vascular involvement was not statistically significant. In patients undergoing radiation therapy, only perineural invasion negatively influenced the 5-year survival prognosis.\nNine of the seventeen patients with Skp2 positive nuclei (≥20%) developed nodal metastasis. Conversely, only 6 of the 54 patients with a nuclear positivity lower than 20% developed a laterocervical metastasis (P=0.001). When comparing survival curves of Skp≥20% and Skp2. Over- expression of MET receptor is correlated to nodal metasta- ses in all cases studied.\nConclusions: The prognostic value of many parameters is widely recognized. The combined evaluation of ‘composite factors’ is promising.\nThere is an important correlation between a Skp2 expres- sion lower than 20% and the capability of the tumour not to develop nodal metastases (p=0.001).\nMutated MET can undergo clonal expansion during me- tastatic spread of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting that this gene might play an impor- tant role in the progression from primary cancer to metastasis." ;

Indeed patients with BPD more frequently suffer from medical conditions such as cardiovascular illness, hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, respiratory disease, liver disease, peptic ulcer, and arthritis. Since some clinical characteristics have been associated with worse course and outcome of BPD, it is possible that they might also bring to an increased medical burden in patients with BPD. The aim of the present report is to assess the prevalence of medical conditions in patients with BPD, and to determine the clinical variables associated with the presence of a medical condition.\nMETHODS:\nCharts of patients with BPD I and II were reviewed: socio-demographic and clinical information were collected. Medical conditions were classified by the ICD-10 and grouped according to the Cumulative Illness Rating Scales in: cardiac, vascular, hematopoietic, respiratory, ear/nose/throat, upper and lower gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, neurologic, endocrine/metabolic. The associations between the presence of medical conditions and demographic/clinical variables of BPD were then analyzed.\nRESULTS:\nCharts of 309 patients were included in the study. 170 (55%) patients had at least one medical condition. The most common were endocrine/metabolic disease (23%), and vascular disease (21%). Having a medical condition was associated with longer duration of untreated illness and female gender.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPatients with BPD have high rates of medical conditions, especially hypertension and metabolic disorders. A longer duration of untreated illness is associated with having a medical condition, probably due to the long-lasting adoption on unhealthy lifestyles not counterbalanced by treatment and psychoeducation." ;

Moreover, in vitro in cells from diabetic patients exposed to insulin at 50 microU/mL PDH activation also occurs; in cells of controls the same happens for insulin at 5 microU/mL, whereas at 50 microU/mL inhibition takes place. Therefore, the low PDH activity in cells of NIDDM patients might be caused by defective insulin control on the enzyme and its recovery in gliclazide-treated patients by drug-mediated removal of the defect. The validity of the hypothesis was verified in this study where cells of NIDDM patients before and after gliclazide treatment were exposed, in vitro, to insulin at 5 and 50 microU/mL and then tested for PDH activity. In such conditions, the profile of PDH behavior in treated patients was no longer comparable to that in untreated patients but closer to that in euglycemic controls, thus supporting the view that the recovery of PDH activity in NIDDM patients following gliclazide treatment might be the expression of an additional effect that the drug would have in these patients, aimed to renew cell responsiveness to insulin." ;

However, the chromatin marks associated with changes in DNA methylation in adult stem cells during lifetime are still largely unknown. Here, DNA methylation profiling of mesenchymal stem cells obtained from individuals aged 2 to 92 identified 18735 hypermethylated and 45407 hypomethylated CpG sites associated with aging. As in differentiated cells, hypermethylated sequences were enriched in chromatin repressive marks. Most importantly, hypomethylated CpG sites were strongly enriched in the active chromatin mark H3K4me1 in stem and differentiated cells, suggesting this is a cell type-independent chromatin signature of DNA hypomethylation during aging. Analysis of scedasticity showed that interindividual variability of DNA methylation increased during aging in MSCs and differentiated cells, providing a new avenue for the identification of DNA methylation changes over time. DNA methylation profiling of genetically identical individuals showed that both the tendency of DNA methylation changes and scedasticity depended on non-genetic as well as genetic factors. Our results indicate that the dynamics of DNA methylation during aging depend on a complex mixture of factors that include the DNA sequence, cell type and chromatin context involved, and that, depending on the locus, the changes can be modulated by genetic and/or external factors." ;

Frozen semen from 10 Italian Friesian and 10 Italian Brown testing bulls was used for the investigation. For each bull, more than 5,000 sperm were analyzed, for a total of 52,586 and 51,342 sperm cells for the 2 breeds, respectively. The present study revealed - in both breeds - a preponderance of the Y-bearing sperm compared to the X-bearing sperm. Within each breed, a statistically significant variation in the various classes of aneuploidy (XX, YY and XY) was found: differences were found in the Friesian breed among the 3 diploidy classes, and in the Brown breed, among the 3 disomy classes (p < 0.05) as well as among the 3 diploidy classes (p < 0.01). However, the 2 breeds did not differ significantly in the overall mean rates of X-Y aneuploidy (disomy + diploidy) which amounts to 0.162% in the Italian Friesian and 0.142% in the Italian Brown. When meiosis I (MI) and II (MII) errors were compared, statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) were found in the disomy classes and in both breeds, whereas the differences between diploidy classes were not significant. Compared to humans, a lower level of aneuploidy has been found in the domestic species analyzed so far. The present study contributes to the establishment of a baseline level of aneuploidy in the sperm populations of 2 cattle breeds which could be used for monitoring future trends of reproductive health, especially in relation to environmental changes and mutagens." ;

Camptothecin (CPT) is a potent DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitor that presents strong antitumoral efficacy in both hematological and epithelial malignancies. However, its use is limited because of its high degradability and weak solubility. Indeed, the structure of camptothecin presents a lactone ring that is subjected to hydrolysis in physiological conditions with consequent inactivation of the topoisomerase binding activity. In the present study a new formulation of CPT embedded in cyclodextrin-based nanosponges (CN-CPT) has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo on prostate cancer models. CN-CPT manifested a strong antitumoral efficacy revealed by MTT and colony forming assay on hormonal independent PC-3 and DU145 cells, significantly higher as compared to the same dose of free CPT. Moreover, cell cycle analysis and annexin V/PI staining showed that CN-CPT treatments induced significant apoptotic cell death at 1 nM (61.7% apoptotic cell death; p<<0.001), where free CTP (4.36% apoptotic cell death) was not effective. The efficacy of CN-CPT has been tested in vivo in PC3 and DU145 xenograft experiments that have confirmed a significant improvement of antitumoral activity of CN-CPT as compared to CPT. To evaluate possible antimetastatic activity of CPT, in vitro experiments of tumor cell adhesion to HUVECs as a model of endothelium and cell motility were performed. Results showed that CN-CPT is effective at lower doses compared to CPT in inducing inhibition of adhesion and motility. In order to evaluate whether androgen receptor signaling could affect the responsiveness to either CPT or CN-CPT the AR expressing murine models of prostate cancer (MYC-AD, PTEN8 and PTEN CAP8) have been used. Results showed that expression of functional AR diminished the efficacy of both CPT and CN-CPT. However the latter still exerted greater effects compared to CN-CPT. Taken together these results support the use of CPT and the development of nanotechnologies for drug delivery in the treatment of castrate refractory prostate cancer." ;

We aimed to compare the occurrence of acute pancreatitis in a population of patients with type 2 diabetes who received incretins compared with those who received other antidiabetic treatment. Methods: In our population-based matched case-control study, we extracted information from an administrative database from Piedmont, Italy (containing data for 4·4 million inhabitants). From a dataset of 282 429 patients receiving treatment with antidiabetic drugs for type 2 diabetes, we identified 1003 cases older than 41 years who had been admitted to hospital for acute pancreatitis between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2012, and 4012 controls who were matched for sex, age, and time of start of antidiabetic therapy. We compared incretin exposure in cases and controls with a conditional logistic regression model, expressed as odds ratios (ORs [95% CI]). We adjusted all analyses for risk factors of acute pancreatitis, as ascertained by hospital discharge records, and concomitant use of metformin or glibenclamide. Findings: The mean age of cases and controls (72·2 years [SD 11·1]) was high, as expected in an unselected diabetic population in Europe. After adjustment for available confounders, use of incretins in the 6 months before hospital admission was not associated with increased risk of acute pancreatitis (OR 0·98, 95% CI 0·69-1·38; p=0·8958). Interpretation: Our findings suggest that, in an unselected population, use of incretins is not associated with an increased risk of acute pancreatitis. Larger studies are needed to clarify whether age or type of incretin therapy could affect the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes.

BALF ADA activity increases in active sarcoidosis as well as in tuberculosis, as a result of activation, differentiation and proliferation of blood-derived mononuclear alveolar cells. In sarcoidosis this hypothesis is supported by the significant positive correlation observed between ADA activity and both the number of alveolar CD4+ lymphocytes and the number of alveolar lymphocytes bearing activation antigens (CD25 and VLA-1). BALF FN levels increase, showing highest values in active sarcoidosis. ADA and FN elevation in BALF from active sarcoidosis patients could be suggested as additional markers of disease activity. Highest BALF ADA/Albumin ratio observed in pulmonary tuberculosis patients suggests an increased local production and differentiates pulmonary tuberculosis from active sarcoidosis. Increased FN/Albumin ratio observed in non active sarcoidosis appears to be related to a similar mechanism during the reparative process following granulomatous inflammation." ;

Evidences of therapy effectiveness have\nbeen assessed in gross motor function rehabilitation in children\naffected by cerebral palsy (CP) and in subjects affected by\nspinal lesions.

A completeforensic approach was performed through autopsy, histological, andmicrobiological examinations and final results showed that the cause ofdeath was due to an Eosinophilic Myocarditis (EM).This presentation will impact the forensic science communityshowing that eosinophilic myocarditis is a rare, potentially fatal diseaseif left untreated.Eosinophilic myocarditis is a histological diagnosis characterizedby a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate containing a variable amount ofeosinophils within the myocardium. This phenomenon may beassociated with a variety of disease such as idiopathic hypereosinophilicsyndrome (IHES), hypersensitivity myocarditis, giant cell myocarditis,toxic myocarditis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, or parasitic infection.Clinical presentation includes a wide spectrum of nonspecific signsand symptoms: chest pain, fever, shortness of breath, chills, cough, butthey are not always present at the same time and sometimes unusualsymptoms, such as epigastric pain, can be the only indication of apathological state. They can be also associated with peripheraleosinophilia and transient or persistent left ventricular dysfunction.EM is considered, together with coronary heart dissection, one ofthe clinical presentations of peripartum cardiomyopathy that usuallyoccurs one month before to six months following delivery. EM etiologyand pathogenesis are unknown: eosinophils may be present andactivated because of the systemic hormonal perturbation occurringduring the period of uterine involution.A major problem is that EM is rarely recognized clinically and isoften first discovered only at postmortem examination.A correct diagnostic approach in these patients should include anechocardiogram study (with evidence of low ejection fraction anddecreased left ventricular systolic function) and an endomyocardialbiopsy (confirming eosinophils as a major inflammatory cellcomponent).If successfully diagnosed, EM can be treated with beta-blockers andACE inhibitors to support heart failure and corticosteroids to reduce theinflammatory process that is involving the myocardium. Prognosis isstrictly linked to ventricular function recovery because those patientswith severe myocarditis-induced heart failure have less survival chancesif normal cardiac function is not restored.Few EM cases are reported in literature and most of them are basedonly on autopsy diagnosis.A case is reported of a 29-year-old woman who was admitted tocritical care unit in respiratory and cardiac failure, three weeks aftergiving birth. Patient clinical history was non-existent for allergy orautoimmune diseases. The third day after birth, she complained ofthoracic pain but echocardiogram was negative. During hospitalizationphysicians treated her with antacids and gastric inhibitors and then shewas discharged with prescription of proton pump inhibitors with thesuggestion of gastroenterology visit. The following three weeks wherecharacterized by growing anterior and back thoracic pain associated withgeneral discomfort, but neither specific symptoms nor peripheraleosinophils increase were present; only inflammatory indexes (velocityof erythrocyte sedimentation, VES, and creatine kinase, CK) wereslightly increased. With progressive and worsening clinical symptoms,she was finally sent to emergency room in critical condition: dyspnea,confusion, fever, and tachycardia. Echocardiogram showed severe leftventricular systolic dysfunction and 25% of ejection fraction; chestradiograph and TC displayed pleural effusion with general edema.

The name can be analyzed as a preconstruction resulting from the transformation of 1) personal stories told in the first person singular by victims and of 2) collective protests told by women in the first person plural signaling thereby their belonging to a social category defined by a common oppression by men. Abstract names are a way to erase any trace of subjectivity from the discourse and are therefore typical of international organizations such as the Council of Europe. However, a discourse analysis can make the past reemerge from the present and a subjective, militant enunciation resurface from a consensual abstract discourse. Therefore, although the Council of Europe adopts discursive strategies which neutralize subjectivity as well as conflicts between man and woman, it places itself within a discursive field that still bares the memory of those who first spoke out against domestic violence as a result of male domination over women. The Council of Europe’s discursive identity is therefore pluralistic as, no matter its will, it is both universalistic and feminist." ;

In this study we evaluated the resolution level achieved by the Heterozygous Ambiguity Resolution Primers (HARPs) method in patients who underwent haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and relative donors. 664 SBT typed individuals (373 for HLA-A,B,DRB1 – year 2004 - and 291 for HLA-C - 2005) were reanalyzed by the light of the 2006 database (Assign SBTTM 3.5 software, Conexio Genomics, Applecross, Western Australia) in order to define ambiguous typings and relative frequencies: 67.8% of samples resulted ambiguous for locus HLA-A, 61.9% for HLA-B, 81.8% for HLA-C and 49.9% for HLA-DRB1. We thus evaluated the hypothetical resolution percentages of HARPs. Finally we performed analyses using specific HARPs for 90 ambiguous typings (23 HLA-A, 26 HLA-B, 27 HLA-C, 14 HLA-DRB1). We obtained different levels of resolution: 1) 28.9% ambiguities were completely resolved (11/23 for HLA-A, 8/26 for HLA-B, 3/27 for HLA-C, 4/14 for HLA-DRB1); 2) 33.3% were resolved with the HARPs, although ambiguities due to polymorphisms located out of exons 2 (class I-II) and 3 (class I) still remain (7/26 HLA-B, 13/27 HLA-C, 10/14 HLADRB1); 3) 22.2% were resolved, but null alleles still remain (10/ 23 HLA-A, 5/26 HLA-B, 5/27 HLA-C); 4) 8.9% were partially resolved (1/23HLA-A, 2/26HLA-B, 5/27HLA-C); 5) 6.7%were not resolved at all (1/23 HLA-A, 4/26 HLA-B, 1/27 HLA-C).

        dcterms:abstract            "death of a masochist resulting from autoerotic behavior.This presentation will impact the forensic science community bybringing attention to the unusual practice of compressing the neck andchest during masochistic activities, along with other information relatedto basic crime scene investigation, reconstruction of events, and autopsyfindings in these type cases.Fatal masochistic asphyxia is a relatively rare phenomenonsecondary to the malfunction of apparatus used to provide sexualpleasure. The basic mechanism of sexual asphyxia is the creation ofcerebral hypoxia which, according to the literature, is generally broughtabout by constriction of the neck by use of a ligature. In a smallpercentage of cases, less typical methods of sexual asphyxia involvingchest and abdominal compression are also employed. In all such cases,hypotheses of suicide and homicide must not be ruled out.Acase of a 52-year-old man found dead in the house where he livedalone is reported here. The corpse was found in his study, lying supineon the floor, underneath an open chair bed with a 1.3 x 3.2 metermattress. The victim’s head protruded from under the mattress and waspartially covered by two blankets. One of the legs of the chair-bed wasdiscovered pressing perpendicularly into his throat, between which arubber slipper was positioned, and whose sole was facing the anteriorportion of his neck in midline. An iron support bar, which made up partof the bed frame, was pressed against the chest and upper abdomen,causing the bed frame to be elevated off floor. He was wearing typicalmen’s pajamas, underneath which he wore boxer shorts with the flyopen. Autopsy revealed the clear imprint of the slipper’s sole on theanterior side of the neck. There was no fracture of the hyoid bone orthyroid cartilage, but several deep muscle bruises of the neck wereidentified. Histological analysis revealed a hemorrhage of the jugularvein and injury to the vagus nerve. An examination of the lungs revealeda large solid mass (7 cm in diameter) occupying the inferior lobe of theright lung; nodules and sclerotal patches involving the omentum wereobserved, along with the presence of very large adhesions of theperitoneum together with sub-obstructions of the bowel. Toxicologicalexamination revealed no substances of abuse in the blood or urine. Thecause of death was attributed to asphyxia by external compression ofbreathing apparatusFurther investigation of the victims’ history revealed that he wasunder the care of a psychologist, due to the fact that he the had habit ofplacing heavy objects (especially books and chairs) onto his chest orabdomen with the purpose of engaging in masochistic sexualgratification. This practice interfered with his ability to becomeintimately involved with women, and so he sought out psychologicalhelp to free him from this behavior. The victims’ medical history isunknown, including the fact that he had cancer. As far as is known, nosuicidal ideation was ever expressed by the victim.These findings suggest that the manner of death should be classifiedas accidental. However, the unusual circumstances involved in this case,including the presence of cancer, does not rule out that the death mayhave indeed been suicidal." ;

We show that when all the bidders are rational such a selling mechanism can lead to positive profits only if there is a large mismatch between the auctioneer's and the bidders' valuation. On the contrary, the auction becomes highly lucrative if at least some bidders are myopic. In this second case, we analyze the key role played by the existence of some private signals that the seller sends to the bidders about the status of their bids.

Methods: 329 healthy and dyslipidemic children/adolescents (age 10.10±3.40) underwent B-mode ultrasound. Among dyslipidemic children 88 resulted FH, 74 FCHL, 56 dominant Hypercholesterolemia, 43  Hyperlipoprotein(a), 10 FHTG and 1 sitosterolemia. 57 were unaffected control subjects. cIMT and aIMT were assessed by using B-mode ultrasound. Results: In all subjects IMT measurement increased with age independently from gender. Both cIMT and aIMT correlated respectively with LDL-C (ρ=0.129, p=0.020; ρ=0.124, p=0.041), ApoB (ρ=0.150, p=0.007; ρ=0.158, p=0.01), non-HDL-C (ρ=0.128, p=0.021; ρ=0.138, p=0.023) and ApoB/ApoA1 (ρ=0.185, p=0.001; ρ=0.141, p=0.022). A negative correlation was found between cIMT and ApoA1 (ρ=-0.179, p=0.01). Furthermore aIMT resulted significantly related to CT levels (ρ=0.128, p=0.034). Conclusion: The present study shows, for the first time in children, a correlation between cIMT and aIMT with LDL-C, ApoB, ApoB/apoA1, non-HDL-C, as well as aIMT with CT.  ApoB and ApoA1, as well as non-HDL-C, are accurate summary of CVD risk factors and are considered new good marker risk as regards to the conventional ones. It should be underlined that non-HDL-C can be routinely assessed in the clinical practice because it results an easy and cheap measure already useful in hypertrigliceridemic patients. This study support the effectiveness of ApoB and non-HDL-C values, as well as cIMT and aIMT measurements, as preclinical markers of atherosclerosis in childhood." ;

Although screening studies suggested that PAH has emerged as major complication of thalassemia patients, its impact on survival is unknown; the pathophysiology of the PAH in these patients is multifactorial, and a thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential. Understanding the PAH pathogenesis, diagnostic options, prevention is critical for clinicians who care for the thalassemic patients; there are virtually no high-quality data on the safety/efficacy of PAH treatment strategy in this patient population. We are reporting the case of a thalassemic patient suffering from progressive severe PAH, not responding to medical treatment and related to chronic thromboembolic disease. After carefully considering all the options, we decided to proceed with vascular disobliteration by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), the first line choice in these cases. This intervention led to a significant improvement in the clinical status and in the functional parameters. Therefore, even if haemolytic anemia-associated-PAH is included in the group I of the Dana-point classification, an individualized approach is recommended as well as a particular management with disease-specific measures and a comprehensive evaluation of other causes of PAH; this current report supports the feasibility and effectiveness of PEA also in the thalassemic patients with surgically accessible chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension" ;

We used the Carbon Budget Model (CBM) to estimate C stock changes and emissions from fires on AR lands at country level. Italy was chosen because it has one of the highest annual rates of AR in Europe and the same model was recently applied to Italy’s forest management area. We considered the time period 1990-2020 with two case studies reflecting different average annual rates of AR: 78 kha yr-1, based on the 2013 Italian National Inventory Report (NIR, official estimates), and 28 kha yr-1, based on the Italian Land Use Inventory System (IUTI estimates). We compared these two different AR rates with eight regional forest inventories and three independent local studies. The average annual C stock change estimated by CBM, excluding harvest or natural disturbances, was equal to 1738 Gg C yr-1 (official estimates) and 630 Gg C yr-1 (IUTI estimates). Results for the official estimates are consistent with the estimates reported by Italy to the KP for the period 2008-2010; for 2011 our estimates are about 20% higher than the country’s data, probably due to different assumptions on the fire disturbances, the AR rate and the dead wood and litter pools. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that: (i) the impact on the AR sink of different assumptions of species composition is small; (ii) the amount of harvest provided by AR has been negligible for the past (< 3%) and is expected to be small in the near future (up to 8% in 2020); (iii) forest fires up to 2011 had a small impact on the AR sink (on average, < 100 Gg C yr-1). Finally the comparison of the historical AR rates reported by NIR and IUTI with other independent sources gives mixed results: the regional inventories support the AR rates reported by the NIR, while some local studies suggest AR rates somehow intermediate between NIR and IUTI. In conclusion, this study suggests that the CBM can be applied at country level to estimate the C stock changes resulting from AR, including the effect of harvest and fires, though only a comparison with results based on direct field measurements could verify the model’s capability to estimate the real C stock change." ;

The survey of cuff pressure is essential in the preventing this iatrogenic complication. That may be performed directv by using a manometer connected to aspecific external device of the tube or Dy chest radiography. The radiological images help the physician to recognize the correct positioning o f the tube and the cuff volume. Inflated cuff could touch but not distend the tracheal wal. If the ratio of the inflated cuff diameter to the tracheal lumen diameter exceeds 150%, tracheomalacia or TEF are likely to result. Surgical correction is required because spontaneous closure is rare. In the suspect of medical or nursing malpractice, all clinical records of patient have to be available.

The mechanism by whichonly some subjects who are exposed to an intense traumatic eventdevelop PTSD is still not completely clear (Shear, 2002). The studypresented here proposes to identify predictive risk factors related todeveloping PTSD through data gathered from the survivors of an airdisaster in which 16 people died and 23 were wounded.Method: The investigations were conducted six months followingthe traumatic event by a team that consisted of four psychiatristsspecialized in clinical and forensic psychiatry, two forensicpsychologists, and two medical legal doctors.In order to increase diagnostic accuracy and to avert any attempts atfeigning harm (Hall, 2007), two expert psychiatrists, randomly chosenfrom among the four examiners, jointly conducted psychiatricobservations of each of the survivors using the Clinician-AdministeredPTSD Scale-Diagnostic Version (CAPS-DX) to diagnose post-traumaticstress disorder. Each examiner calculated individual scores and theaverage weighted scores of each of them were used in the final legalmedical diagnoses. Other diagnostic instruments used include the ZungSelf-Rated Anxiety Scale (SAS); Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale(SDS); and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) by McNair, Lorr, andDroppleman.1 With the goal of obtaining an evaluation of personalitystructure, the Rorschach projective test, using the Exner scoring system,was used. The subjects also underwent careful anamnestic and clinicalexaminations to ascertain any prior personal or family psychiatrichistories, as well as to evaluate personality structure and cognitivecapacity. Particular attention was paid to the behavior of each subject inthe periods preceding and following the crash. The investigatorscompared personal declarations given during interviews with those ofthe other survivors, and recorded emotional/affective reactions. Thesubjects’ physical injuries were also evaluated by medical legal doctorsusing the Patient Health Questionnaire 15-Item Somatic SymptomSeverity Scale (PHQ-15) (Kroenke, 2002). This 15-item selfadministereddiagnostic instrument was used to measure the severity ofproblems that arose from the injuries. It consists of seven questionsrelated to regional pain, and eight questions related to general physicaldiscomfort. For each symptom, the subjects’ responses were recorded asfollows: 0 (“not bothered at all”); 1 (“bothered a little”); or, 2 (“bothereda lot”).Results: Six-months following the traumatic event, only four of thesurvivors (22.2%) showed no psychopathological symptomatology.Fourteen survivors (77.8%) exhibited emotional/affective symptomsrelated to the event. Seven (38.9% of the entire sample) presented withall of the symptoms of PTSD; two had co-morbid depressive disorder;and seven presented with subsyndromal psychopathological symptomsfor PTSD, which mostly involved increased arousal (i.e.,hypervigilance, exaggerated startle reaction, and difficulty sleeping).In addition to the severity of the traumatic event itself, other riskfactors identified that correlated to the development of PTSD were theloss of a relative, the manifestation of depressive symptoms, and theseverity of physical injuries sustained. Conversely, low levels of hostilityand high levels of self-efficacy represented protective factors againstdeveloping PTSD.Conclusions: The results demonstrate tha[...]" ;

Adrenal vein sampling is recognised by Endocrine Society guidelines as the only reliable way to correctly diagnose the subtype of primary aldosteronism.

In this Personal View, we address several questions that clinicians are presented with when considering adrenal vein sampling. For each of these questions we provide responses based on the available evidence, and opinions based on our experience. In particular, we discuss the most appropriate way to prepare the patient, whether adrenal vein sampling can be avoided for some subgroups of patients, the use of ACTH (1-24) during the procedure, the most appropriate criteria for interpretation of adrenal vein cannulation and lateralisation, the use of contralateral suppression, and strategies to improve success rates of adrenal vein sampling in centres with little experience" ;

The aim of this pilot randomized placebo-controlled study was to estimate the effects of laser acupuncture on salivary flow rates in patients with severe hyposalivation due to SS. A prospective cohort of 26 female patients affected by SS has been evaluated. The laser therapy equipment used was the Pointer Pulse, emitting light in the red visible spectrum (650 nm), with a power of 5 mW and an irradiation time of 120 s per acupoint, in an area of 3.14 mm(2) (fluence = 19.2 J/cm(2), power density = 0.16 W/cm(2), total dose = 0.6 J). The following acupuncture points were stimulated bilaterally: LI 2 Erjian, ST 5 Daying, ST 6 Jiache, ST 7 Xiaguan, SI 19 Tinggong, and BL 13 Feishu. True laser acupuncture led to a significantly higher amount of saliva production, measured after the end of the protocol (5 weeks), and during the 6-month follow-up period. The results are stable from the end of the protocol until the 3rd month of follow-up; during the last control, a slight but significant decrease in production has also been shown. This preliminary study proposes laser acupuncture as a possible treatment for improving salivary flow rates in patients with SS, but further validation on a larger sample is still necessary." ;

Tra prima stesura, versioni successive, rifacimenti e limature, infatti, \"Poveri e semplici\" e \"Il cappello piumato\", tengono impegnata Anna Maria Ortese dal 1960 al 1967, mentre la loro vicenda editoriale, costellata di tradimenti, ritardi e rifiuti, si protrae fino al 1979. Tra la fine degli anni Cinquanta e l’inizio degli anni Sessanta, inoltre, Ortese si trova in una delicata fase di passaggio. Proprio da questo momento di crisi, che è insieme privata, politica e creativa, nasce il dattiloscritto steso a Milano nel dicembre 1960 e dal quale deriveranno sia \"Poveri e semplici\" (1967) sia \"Il cappello piumato\" (1979). Nello \"spazio autobiografico\" inaugurato da quel testo, Ortese compie da un lato il passaggio dal regime del racconto a quello del romanzo, dall’altro individua e precisa i caratteri della propria scrittura autobiografica, nella sua duplice connotazione romanzesca (che approda al \"Porto di Toledo\") e saggistica (che da \"In sonno e in veglia\" si prolunga fino a \"Corpo celeste\")." ;

Perimyocarditis was diagnosed in patients with clinical criteria for acute pericarditis, elevation of cardiac markers of injury, and evidence of new onset of focal or diffuse depressed left ventricular function by echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance. The rationale for these diagnostic criteria is that pure pericardial or predominant pericardial inflammatory involvement is not characterized by significant impairment of myocardial function and that, on the contrary, focal or diffuse abnormalities of ventricular wall motion or function imply substantial myocardial inflammatory involvement.3 On this basis, we disagree and believe that reported clinical criteria have been published several times previously and are based on the best available clinical evidence. Obviously, there is a need for further research and especially a better understanding of the pathophysiology, but a proper classification with or without myocardial involvement and with or without ventricular dysfunction is clinically useful and may help guide different management strategies (similar for pericarditis and myopericarditis, ie, pericarditis with mild myocardial involvement and preserved ventricular function, and similar for perimyocarditis and myocarditis).\n\nSecond, the article included all consecutive patients with pericardial inflammatory syndromes (acute pericarditis, myopericarditis, and perimyocarditis) and thus there is no reason to exclude patients with systemic inflammatory syndromes who may be a part of the group.2,3\nThird, the pathophysiology of inflammatory myopericardial syndromes is still under investigation, and the adopted classification and diagnostic criteria are clinically based and useful in clinical practice. We would like also to clarify that troponin was measured serially in all patients.\nIn conclusion, we presented commonly adopted clinical criteria that are useful for the clinical management of patients with mixed forms of inflammatory myopericardial involvement. Further research is obviously needed to better understand the pathophysiology and to improve treatment, and study of the long-term outcomes is needed." ;

Recruited centers were asked to complete a preliminary general report followed by a single form/patient. Referral physicians were not required to exhibit any specific certificate of competency in CMR imaging.\nRESULTS:\nExams were performed with 1.5T scanners in 96% of cases followed by 3T (3%) and 1T (1%) magnets and contrast was administered in 84% of cases. The majority of cases were performed for the workup of inflammatory heart disease/cardiomyopathies representing overall 55.7% of exams followed by the assessment of myocardial viability and acute infarction (respectively 6.9% and 5.9% of patients).

ABSTRACT 2: L’a. premette un capitolo relativo alla formazione della prova e alla ripartizione legale, illustrando le varie teorie sulla distinzione tra fatti costitutivi e impeditivi. Quindi sottolinea come nell’ordinamento siano riscontrabili numerose ipotesi di inversione o modificazione legale ovvero giurisprudenziale dell’onere della prova. Si introduce così il tema dei patti probatori, che viene trattato nei capitoli successivi. # L’a., dopo avere tracciato un profilo storico, distingue tra i patti sull’onere della prova, ammessi dal legislatore con le limitazioni di cui all’art. 2698 c.c., e gli ulteriori patti che hanno ad oggetto la prova, la cui validità viene tradizionalmente negata, ma che trovano implicito riconoscimento nell’art. 1469 bis c.c., dove il legislatore considera presuntivamente abusive e quindi inefficaci – oltre alle clausole in tema di inversione o modificazione dell'onere della prova – le clausole che sanciscano a carico del consumatore limitazioni all'allegazione di prove. # L’a. si domanda quindi se, nell’ottica di protezione dei contraenti deboli, anche nei contratti per adesione ex artt. 1341 e 1342 c.c. (che non necessariamente vedono dalla parte dell’aderente un mero consumatore, ma possono interessare un professionista o un imprenditore di forza contrattuale inferiore a quella di chi ha predisposto il testo del contratto) operi una qualche tutela verso i destinatari di patti probatori. Nell’elenco delle clausole vessatorie individuate dal secondo comma dell’art. 1341 c.c., per le quali occorre la specifica sottoscrizione a pena di loro inefficacia, manca infatti l’esplicita menzione dei patti di inversione o modificazione dell’onere della prova ovvero di quelli inerenti alla limitazione all’allegazione di prove. # Ritiene l’a., con il conforto della comparazione e nel quadro della moderna tendenza ad estendere le tutele verso la parte debole del contratto emersa in vari campi (ad es. anche in quello dei contratti di subfornitura nelle attività produttive, disciplinati dalla l. 18.6.98, n. 192, dove travalicando i confini della subfornitura si introduce il concetto di abuso di dipendenza economica, ricollegandovi la nullità delle clausole contrattuali che lo realizzano), che le clausole sull’inversione o modificazione dell’onere della prova possano rientrare tra quelle che stabiliscono limitazioni alla facoltà di opporre eccezioni, espressamente prevedute come vessatorie dall’art. 1342, 2° comma, c.c. # La trattazione si conclude con una rassegna di casi giurisprudenziali in cui si è discusso della validità di clausole contrattuali per l’appunto inerenti a patti di inversione o modificazione dell’onere della prova o comunque sulle prove.\n\nSOMMARIO: CAPITOLO I – PROVA E ONERE DELLA PROVA – 1.1 La formazione della prova – 1.2 L’onere della prova come regola di giudizio – 1.3 La ripartizione legale dell’onere della prova: – 1.3.1 la distinzione tra fatti costitutivi e impeditivi - 1.3.2 ancora sulla distinzione tra fatti costitutivi e impeditivi – 1.4 L’inversione o modificazione legale dell’onere della prova – 1.5 L’inversione o modificazione giurisprudenziale dell’onere della prova – 1.6 L’inversione o modificazione unilaterale dell’onere della prova. – CAPITOLO II – PATTI PROBATORI IN GENERALE – 2.1 Il profilo storico e la rilevanza pratica dei patti probatori – 2.2 L’art. 2698 c.c. e il riconoscimento dei patti sull’onere della prova – 2.3 Il problema dei patti probatori ulteriori a quelli sull’onere della prova: – 2.3.1 le opinioni dottrinali – 2.3.2 la lettura giurisprudenziale estensiva dell’art. 2698 c.c. – 2.3.3 il richiamo giurisprudenziale all’autonomia contrattual" ;

An electric discharge, generated by a bipolar electrode, gives origin to high-amplitude and low-frequency shock waves in the fluid medium which cause the stone to fragment. Complete resolution of lithiasis was obtained in 2 patients with intrahepatic calculosis. In the other 2 cases of massive lithiasis of intra and extrahepatic bile ducts the treatment, however incomplete, proved to be useful, as the biliary flux was rehabilitated and clinical symptoms disappeared. No relevant immediate side-effects were observed, except for well-tolerated pain during the discharges, and transitory hemobilia which solved spontaneously. No complications were observed in this series of patients. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy proves thus to be useful for supporting standard interventional radiology techniques in very complex cases of intra- and extrahepatic bile duct stones." ;

Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to monitor the ion release into solution, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to unveil the chemistry of the leached surface, and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) was carried out to monitor the structural modifications of the fibres. No significant differences were observed between dissolution experiments carried out with and without H2O2 with the exception of results after the first hour, from which it may be inferred that the dissolution proceeds faster in the presence of H2O2 but only in its very early steps. Congruent mobilization of Si and Mg from crocidolite was observed, increasing with time especially in the range between 1 and 48 h, while Ca decreased after 48 h and Fe was not detected at any incubation time. In the undersaturated conditions (0–48 h), dissolution rate of UICC crocidolite fibres has been estimated to be d(Si)/dt = 0.079 μmol h−1. The fibre surface modification is continuous with time: XPS results showed a regular depletion of Si and Mg and enrichment of Fe along dissolution. The Fe2p3/2 signal on the surface was fitted with four components at 709.0, 710.5, 711.6 and 712.8 eV binding energy values corresponding to: (i) Fe(II)–O and (ii) Fe(III)–O surrounded by oxygen atoms in the silicate structure, (iii) Fe(III)–OOH as a product of the dissolution process, and (iv) Fe in a phosphate precipitate (Fe–P), respectively. The evolution of Fe speciation on the crocidolite surface was followed by integrating the four photoemission peaks, and results showed that the oxidative environment promotes the formation of Fe(III)–O (up to 37% Fetot) and of Fe–P species (up to 16% Fetot), which are found on the fibre surface at the end of the dissolution experiment. HR-TEM showed that the crocidolite lattice structure, the fibrous habit and the high aspect ratio are preserved upon leaching, while Fe-bearing nanoparticles, likely amorphous and possibly displaced on top of the fibres, become clearly visible. As a conclusion, coating of the crocidolite fibres was demonstrated to occur due to precipitation of Fe-rich phases (both phosphates and oxide-hydroxides). The occurrence of such iron armouring may modulate asbestos toxicity and possibly be the initial step in the formation of asbestos ferruginous bodies." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "In the 1970s, Italy’s national identity was transformed and re-negotiated consequent to a number of tragic events and radical reforms. The country’s image and self-image were constantly revisited in domestic and foreign news features. To this day, the best-known verbal icon of that period remains the phrase “strategia della tensione” (strategy of tension), from the headline of an article in the British press. This highlights a tendency of the Italian newspapers to “look up” to the British newspapers. The aim of this chapter is to investigate how this tendency to prioritize British images of the Italian scenario, turning them into tropes, influenced the construction of Italy’s image between 1969 and 1980. A parallel corpus of articles from The Times and La Stampa is explored through a methodological framework combining diachronic News Translation Studies and the strategies of Imagology. Electronic querying and manual inspection of the corpus revealed cases of textual migration, consisting of textual segments in La Stampa mirroring excerpts from The Times. These migrated texts were identified and labelled according to the translation strategy employed – selective appropriations, permutations, omissions, and additions (Valdeón 2008) – in order to investigate potential agendas, gatekeeping or self-censorship practices. However, rather than display an agenda, this analysis seems to reveal a clash between the British image and Italy’s self-image in the troubled 1970s, the latter being constructed through heavy domestication of the British articles. Translation choices indeed reveal patterns of mitigation of criticism, as well as foregrounding of positive comments, which require a discourse-based approach in order to be fully understood. The strategies of Imagology – notably those applied to Translation Studies in recent work by van Doorslaer (2010) – prove particularly useful in detailing these findings, through close observation of the constructed images of the country." ;

InJune of 1996, persons investigating child abuse and neglect were maileda pamphlet from the U.S. Department of Justice entitled, “RecognizingWhen a Child’s Injury or Illness is Caused by Abuse,” with a specificpart dedicated to aging of bruises. The pamphlet gave a very clear cutdescription of color of bruise versus age of bruise, as follows: Red 0-2days; Blue, Purple 2-5 days; Green 5-7 days; Yellow 7-10 days; Brown10-14 days. However, a colorimetric scale for forensic photographybased on the bruise colors has never been proposed, as photographiccolor reproduction is unreliable and depends on several factors, likecamera, lighting, printer, and photo-editing color calibration.The purpose of this study is to propose two prototype colorimetricscales with and without linear measurement, each with six bruisingcolors based on RGB color model, three circles with black and whitecalibrators to be used for forensic photography of skin injuries of whiteEuropean population, during different stages of healing. The prototypescales were employed during forensic photographic imaging of cases ofblunt trauma and bitemarks.This study does not attempt to give a definitive account of thedifferent scientific methods available for the assessment of the age ofbruising. This presentation will present an opinion that a color aid whenanalyzing photos could assist with the interpretation and accuracy ofestimation of bruise age, especially when the analysis it made directly ondigital images prior to printing. Such an aid would give a reliablestandard condition and allow color calibration. It is essential that thecolors within the image represent colors within the bruise under standardand reliable conditions.Observation on a large sample of blunt trauma and bitemarkinjuries applying the proposed colorimetric scales is needed to verifyand validate the preliminary results obtained, although bruise ageestimation remains an expert opinion with several degrees of accuracyand variability. For this reason colors within the bruise have to beanalyzed by experienced and confident observers along with every andany relevant findings and observations in order to prevent errors ormisjudgment.A synergy between medical examiners and odontologists is alsoadvisable for a more acceptable forensic interpretation in order to assessthe correction parameters to be used in the proposed colorimetric scale." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "PURPOSE OF REVIEW:\n\nIn the last 2 years, several reports have dealt with recruitment/positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) selection. Most of them confirm previous results and few add new information.\nRECENT FINDINGS:\n\nIt has been definitely confirmed that opening pressures are different throughout the acute respiratory distress syndrome lung parenchyma, ranging from 5-10 up to 30-40 cmH2O. The highest opening pressures are required to open the most dependent lung regions. It has been found that in 2 s, most of the recruitable lung regions may be open when a proper pressure is applied. The best way to assess recruitment is computed tomography scanning, whereas lung mechanics are a reasonable bedside surrogate. Impedance tomography has been increasingly tested, whereas gas exchange is the less reliable indicator of recruitment. A large outcome study showed that higher PEEP might provide survival benefit in a subgroup of more severe patients as compared with lower PEEP. To set PEEP in each individual patient, the use of the expiratory limb of the pressure-volume curve has been suggested. Setting PEEP according to transpulmonary pressure has a robust physiological background, although it requires confirmatory study.\nSUMMARY:\n\nIndiscriminate application of recruitment maneuver in unselected acute respiratory distress syndrome population does not provide benefits. However, in the most severe patients, recruitment maneuver has to be considered and higher PEEP applied. To individualize PEEP, the expiratory phase has to be considered, and the esophageal pressure measurement to compute the transpulmonary pressure should be progressively introduced in clinical practice." ;

The immune system plays a key role in the achievement of the sustained virological response (SVR). Vitamin D seems to influence antiviral response in chronic hepatitis C and its pathway is controlled by polymorphic genes as CYP27B1, CYP24A1 and VDR. In this study, we have investigated the correlation among the treatment outcomes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the above mentioned genes and IL28B ones.\n\nMETHODS:\nOne hundred and twelve HCV-2/3 patients treated with interferon plus ribavirin were retrospectively studied; allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR.\n\nRESULTS:\nCYP24A1rs2585428, IL28Brs12979860 and rs8099917 SNPs affected the non response and BMI, Metavir score, IL28Brs8099917TT and CYP24A1rs2585428GG were the only factors able to predict it. SVR was predicted by Metavir score, HCV-RNA at baseline and early virological response (EVR). IL28Brs12979860 SNP and HCV-RNA were also related to rapid virological response (RVR). EVR was predicted by BMI, Metavir score and CYP24A1rs2585428 SNP. IL28Brs8099917TT and FokITT were relapse prediction factors.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nAs well as to non genetic factors, SNPs in vitamin D pathway seem to have a role in HCV-2/3 therapy outcomes. This study reveals the likely usefulness of pharmacogenetic-based ribavirin and interferon therapy to help identify patients for whom therapy could be successful or not, also considering the new future expensive therapy options. To date, no similar data were published on these viral genotypes, but further studies in different and bigger cohorts are needed." ;

Health inequalities were perceived by most policymakers as differences in life-expectancy between population with economic, social and geographical differences. Reducing health inequalities was a priority for the majority of cities which use surveys as sources of information to analyse these. Bureaucracy, funding and population beliefs were the main barriers.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe majority of the interviewed policymakers gave an account of interventions focusing on the immediate determinants and aimed at modifying lifestyles and behaviours in the more disadvantaged classes. More funding should be put towards academic research on effective universal policies, evaluation of their impact and training policymakers and officers on health inequalities in city governments." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Several neuroimaging studies point to a key role of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in the formation of socially relevant impressions. In 3 different experiments, participants were required to form socially relevant impressions about other individuals on the basis of text descriptions of their social behaviors, and to decide whether a face alone, a trait adjective (e.g., “selfish”), or a face presented with a trait adjective was consistent or inconsistent with the impression they had formed. Before deciding whether the target stimulus matched the impression they had previously formed, participants received transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the dmPFC, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, also implicated in social impression formation), or over a control site (vertex). Results from the 3 experiments converged in showing that interfering with dmPFC activity significantly delayed participants in responding whether a face-adjective pair was consistent with the impression they had formed. No effects of TMS were observed following stimulation of the IFG or when evaluations had to be made on faces or trait adjectives presented alone. Our findings critically extend previous neuroimaging evidence by indicating a causal role of the dmPFC in creating coherent impressions based on the integration of face and verbal description of social behaviors." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "PURPOSE: To verify the suitability of indicative quantities to evaluate the risk related to patient exposure, in abdominal and vascular interventional radiology, by the study of correlations between dosimetric quantities and other indicators. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed in vivo measurements of entrance skin dose (ESD) and dose area product (DAP) during 48 procedures to evaluate the correlation among dosimetric quantities, and an estimation of spatial distribution of exposure and effective dose (E). To measure DAP we used a transmission ionization chamber and to evaluate ESD and its spatial distribution we used radiographic film packed in a single envelope and placed near the patient's skin. E was estimated by a calculation software using data from film digitalisation. RESULTS: From the data derived for measurements in 27 interventional procedures on 48 patients we obtained a DAP to E conversion factor of 0.15 mSv / Gy cm2, with an excellent correlation (r=.99). We also found a good correlation between DAP and exposure parameters such as fluoroscopy time and number of images. The greatest effective dose was evaluated for a multiple procedure in the hepatic region, with a DAP value of 425 Gy cm2. The greatest ESD was about 550 mGy. For groups of patients undergoing similar interventional procedures the correlation between ESD and DAP had conversion factors from 6 to 12 mGy Gy-1 cm-2. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of ESD and E by slow films represents a valid method for patient dosimetry in interventional radiology. The good correlation between DAP and fluoroscopy time and number of images confirm the suitability of these indicators as basic dosimetric information. All the ESD values found are lower than threshold doses for deterministic effects." ;

The majority of patients (75-85%) present as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); within this category the most represented stage is Ta (70%), followed by T1 (20%) and, less frequently, carcinoma in situ (CIS) (10%) (2). The diagnosis of NMIBC and, more generally, of bladder cancer, depends on urine cytology and endoscopic examination with histological evaluation of the resected tissue. Clearly, an optimal cystoscopy with accurate transurethral resection (TUR) is of great importance in order to improve the detection rate and to reduce the probability of recurrence and progression. Today the cystoscopy is routinely performed with the white light technique (WLC), the same of about 80 years ago (3). Several studies have demonstrated that an initial TUR with WLC can miss small papillary lesions and, particularly, flat lesions such as CIS. Moreover, recurrence rates of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) are directly related to the possibility of achieving a complete resection: residual cancer is present in a large percentage of re-TUR, showing a not so good performance of resection with this method. For these reasons new methodologies have been investigated in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of WLC, such as photodynamic diagnosis (PDD), narrow band imaging (NBI), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and CT virtual cystoscopy. Some of them have been well established and supported by consistent literature while others are still to be viewed as experimental. The purpose of this review is to investigate the state of the art of these new techniques." ;

Both procedures were performed after ultrasound-guided portal vein puncture and measurement of pre- and postanastomotic pressure gradients. The diameters of the angioplasty catheters ranged from 5 to 10 mm and no stents were used.\nRESULTS:\nIn both cases, it was possible to cross the stenoses, perform angioplasty and obtain an immediate reduction of the pressure gradients. There were no major complications after the procedure. In the first patient, percutaneous treatment allowed us to postpone surgical revision of the anastomosis; in the second case, angioplasty had to be repeated twice over a period of 4 years to finally achieve regular patency of the anastomosis and function of the graft.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nPercutaneous treatment of portal stenosis after paediatric liver transplantation is a safe and feasible treatment; if balloon dilatation does not guarantee functional recovery of the organ, it allows surgical revision to be postponed to a later date when the clinical condition is more stable." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "INTRODUCTION. Langerhans cell histiocytosis, once called histiocytosis X, is a rare disease. Usually it can occur in children and is characterized by granulomas (eosinophilic granuloma and Hand-Schueller-Christian disease) or by a extensive involvement of various organs (Letterer-Siwe disease). The etiology remains uncertain and could be related to undefined immunologic disturbance. Lesions can involve bone marrow, skin, oral mucosa, retro-orbital tissue, central nervous system, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lung, and gastroenteric tract. Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be employed as treatment. Prognosis is different in relation to the extension of the disease. CASE REPORT. In our case (a 33 year old female) came to observation for swelling in temporal region. The patient underwent clinical and radiological examinations: the lesion involved the skull base in the right part of the sphenoid bone. CT and MRI showed a 'clepsydra' lesion with wider extension to infratemporal fossa and to intracranial middle fossa and shrinking in the base of the skull; inside the lesion a lot of wider calcifications were present. A biopsy proved a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. No other localizations of disease were found. The patient was treated with chemotherapy followed by localized radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was performed with 3 cycles of etoposide 260 mg for 3 days every month. After this treatment a response of 25% was observed. Afterwards a radiotherapy with cobalt 60 was employed through two angled wedged fields for a total dose of 22 Gy and conventional fractionation. During the follow-up a slow, partial regression of the lesion with increase of the extension of the calcifications documented by CT and MRI was observed. After 5 years follow-up no progression of disease was observed. DISCUSSION. The usual treatment of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is surgery and eventually radiotherapy for localized disease and chemotherapy for extended disease. The prognosis is related to the number of involved organs: usually favorable with only one site of disease and unfavorable when more organs are involved. Other unfavorable prognostic factors are the age < 2 years, the presence of anemia, liver and spleen involvement and respiratory failure. In our case only one site of disease was evident and the clinical behavior has been quite favorable. The main peculiarities are the radiologic aspect and the slow, partial regression after the treatment; this fact could be related to the presence of wide calcifications inside the lesion. After 5 years follow-up it is possible to consider the absence of progression as a response to the treatment." ;

Advocates of the preservation of language (and cultural) diversity usually emphasize that language diversity is not inimical to the state and its integrity, and that fostering diversity does not jeopardize development. These statements are actually seldom, if ever, proved. A contrary view stresses that economically successful states are most often monolingual; although this may be historically correct, the logical connection between these states of affairs is not explained. The contribution, following and expanding on previous work by the author, argues that the link between these two positions lies in the ideology of the nation-state – including its contemporary democratic variety – which tends to impede, and often actively suppress, language diversity." ;

Methods Escalating doses of pazopanib (400-800 mg once daily [QD]) plus erlotinib (100-150 mg QD) doses were evaluated in cohorts of 3-6 adults with advanced solid tumors. Twelve additional patients were enrolled in an expansion cohort to confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Results The MTD, defined during assessment of 20 patients, was pazopanib 600 mg plus erlotinib 150 mg. Two dose-limiting toxicities, rash and elevated liver enzymes, occurred at pazopanib 800 mg and erlotinib 150 mg. Overall, 30 % and 27 % of patients required dose interruption of pazopanib or erlotinib, respectively; 15 % of patients required a dose reduction of erlotinib to manage toxicities. The most common adverse events in patients treated with any dose regimen of pazopanib plus erlotinib (N = 33) were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and decreased appetite. The adverse-event profile of the combination did not appear to differ from that of each compound administered alone. Coadministration of pazopanib 600 mg QD and erlotinib 150 mg QD did not consistently affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound relative to that observed for either compound administered alone. Of 26 patients evaluated for efficacy, 3 (12 %; all non-small-cell lung cancer) had partial response and 10 (38 %) had stable disease. Conclusions Concomitant administration of pazopanib 600 mg and erlotinib 150 mg is feasible, with a manageable toxicity profile. These results support further clinical development of the pazopanib-erlotinib combination." ;

Results in vitro showed successful differentiation of HMSCs into neuroglial-like cells, characterized by expression of specific neuroglial markers confirmed by immunocytochemistry and by RT-PCR and qPCR targeting specific genes expressed. In vivo testing evaluated during the healing period of 20 weeks, showed no evident positive effect of HMSCs or neuroglial-like cell enrichment at the sciatic nerve repair site on most of the functional and nerve morphometric predictors of nerve regeneration although the nociception function was almost normal. EPT on the other hand, recovered significantly better after HMSCs enriched membrane employment, to values of residual functional impairment compared to other treated groups.

After denudation, the oocytes were\nindividually fixed on slides with 1:1 Carnoy fixative.\nTotally, out of 396 COCs selected for IVM, 305\nreached the MII stage (77.0%); of these, 31 (10.2%)\nwere unreduced. Out of 274 MII reduced oocytes, 200\n(73.0%) had visible PB, therefore were FISH analyzed.\nAneuploid oocytes were 4 out of 200 (2.0%), 3\nwere nullisomic and 1 disomic, all for chromosome 5.\nPremature separation of sister chromatids (PSSC) was\nfound only in two oocytes (1%), one for each breed.\nAt breed level, out of 100 oocytes examined in the\nPodolian, two were found to be nullisomic and one\ndisomic, all for chromosome 5; out of 100 oocytes\nexamined in the Maremmana, only one oocyte was\nfound to be nullisomic for chromosome 5. Interestingly,\nchromosome X was never involved in aneuploidy.\nTotally, the two breeds showed different\naneuploidy rates: 3% (Podolian) vs 1% (Maremmana).\nThese preliminary results, together with\nprevious results obtained on the Friesian and Brown\nbreeds, suggest that ‘interbreed’ differences can be\nfound among the various domestic breeds.

        dcterms:abstract            "he tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET oncogene is activated by gene mutation or amplification in tumors, which in most instances maintain addiction, i.e., dependency, to MET activation. This makes MET an attractive candidate for targeted therapies. Here we show that, in 3/3 MET-addicted human gastric cancer cell lines, MET kinase inhibition resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increased expression of the antiapoptotic small heat-shock protein of 27 kDa (HSP27, HSPB1). HSP27 increase depended on the inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway and on heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) regulation. Importantly, HSP27-silenced MET-addicted cells underwent 2- and 3-fold more apoptosis following MET inhibition in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Likewise, in human cancer cells susceptible to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition, EGFR inhibitors induced HSP27 expression and were strengthened by HSP27 suppression. In control cell lines that were not affected by drugs targeting MET or EGFR, these drugs did not induce HSP27 increase. Therefore, in cancer therapies targeting the MET pathway, the induction of HSP27 might limit the efficacy of anti-MET agents. As HSP27 increase also impairs the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors and is known to protect cells from chemotherapeutics, the induction of HSP27 by targeted agents might strongly affect the success of combination treatments.—Musiani, D., Konda, J.

        dcterms:abstract            "Direct sales are a widespread and important typology of the so-called Alternative Food Networks. The direct links between producers and consumers can take two basic forms: consumers going to buy agricultural products at the farm\n(on-farm sales), and farmers selling their products in urban areas. These practices are an alternative to traditional organizations of the agro-food chains, that typically involve several operators between producers and consumers. It is\ntherefore important to analyse the reasons pushing farmers to adopt this new organization of their marketing chain.\nThis research aims at analysing the territorial distribution of direct links between urban consumers and farmers in Piedmont (Italy), and to assess the main determinants of their choice. Firstly, the territorial distribution of direct sales practices (on-farm or elsewhere) is analysed. This is made possible by the access to micro-data from the 2010 Agricultural Census for Piedmont, a region whose agriculture is characterized by a strong emphasis on quality products. The farms that chose direct sales, both on- and off-farm, are mostly\nconcentrated in specific clusters, such as the hilly wine-growing areas of Langhe and Monferrato, the hilly belt surrounding Torino, and some low Alpine valleys. Secondly, we analyse the determinants of the choice to sell directly to consumers, separately for on-farm and off-farm sales, with probit models. Explanatory variables comprise the\nstructural characteristics of the farms (farm size, type of farming, etc.), the personal characteristics of the operators\nand of the farm households, and the proximity to urban and commercial areas. Operators’ and farm characteristics are found to affect the choice of selling directly, but rather weakly. The most important factors affecting these  choices are farm location and, for on-farm direct sales, the complementarity with agro-tourism and recreational activities." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a frequent cause of morbidity following surgical procedures. Gram-positive cocci, particularly staphylococci, cause many of these infections, although Gram-negative organisms are also frequently involved. The risk of developing a SSI is associated with a number of factors, including aspects of the operative procedure itself, such as wound classification, and patient-related variables, such as preexisting medical conditions. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) plays an important role in reducing SSIs, especially if patient-related risk factors for SSIs are present. The main components of antimicrobial prophylaxis are: timing, selection of drugs and patients, duration and costs. Compliance with these generally accepted preventive principles may lead to overall decreases in the incidence of these infections. Ideally the administration of the prophylactic agent should start within 30 minutes from the surgical incision. The duration of the AP should not exceed 24 hours for the majority of surgical procedures. The shortest effective period of prophylactic antimicrobial administration is not known and studies have demonstrated that post-surgical antibiotic administration is unnecessary. Furthermore, there were no proven benefits in multiple dose regimens when compared to single-dose regimens. The choice of an appropriate prophylactic antimicrobial agent should be based primarily on efficacy and safety. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be avoided due to the risk of promoting bacterial resistance. Cephalosporins are the most commonly used antibiotics in surgical prophylaxis; specifically, cefazolin or cefuroxime are mainly used in the prophylaxis regimens for cardio-thoracic surgery, vascular surgery, hip or knee arthroplasty surgery, neurosurgical procedures and gynecologic and obstetric procedures. A review of the prophylactic regimens regarding the main surgical procedures is presented." ;

In the period from May 1998 to December 2000, 1,382 cases were submitted from 54 Centers in 15 regions of Italy, 54.2% males (mean age +/- SD 50.5 +/- 16.8 years) and 45.8% females (50.2 +/- 15.3 years). A current smoking habit emerges in 18% of subjects; former smokers and never-smokers represent 26% and 56% of the total case series, respectively. The most frequent disease registered is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (37.6%), followed in decreasing order by sarcoidosis (29.2%), and Langherans' cell hystiocytosis (6.6%). High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was considered as the most important tool for final diagnosis in the majority of cases (74.4%); 39.4% of patients underwent transbronchial biopsies, 39.2% bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). A surgical biopsy was performed in 20.5% of patients. A web site has been activated from December 2000 (www.pneumonet.it/ripid), allowing prompt access to all information and scientific material concerning the project and to an electronic form for data collection that can be completed on-line." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "In recent years, a large debate has arisen about the citation advantage of Open Access (OA). Many studies have been conducted on different datasets and according to different perspectives, which led to different and somehow contradictory results depending on the considered disciplinary field, the researchers’ attitude and citational behaviour, and the applied methodology. One of the bibliometric indicators most used worldwide to measure citations is Impact Factor – not free from criticisms and reservations – but it has only been tested on Open Access journals once, in 2004.The aim of this preliminary work, focused on “Gold” Open Access, is to test the performance of Open Access journals with the most traditional bibliometric indicator – Impact Factor, to verify the hypothesis that unrestricted access might turn into more citations and therefore also good Impact Factor indices. Other indicators, such as Immediacy Index and 5-year Impact Factor, will be tested too. The preliminary step of the work was fixing the list of Open Access journals tracked by Thomson Reuters in «Journal Citation Reports» (JCR). JCR was compared to the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) as of 31 December of the corresponding year.As to coverage, Open Access journals in «Journal Citation Reports» are still a small percentage, even though there has been a large increase since 2003 in the Science edition (from 1.47% to 5.38%), less visible in the Social Science edition (from 1.05% to 1.52%, with a slight decrease from the 2007 1.71%).In order to obtain comparable data, absolute Impact Factor or Immediacy Index values were not considered, but rather converted into percentiles for each category. The rank of the Open Access journals was analyzed in each single category. The titles were then clustered in disciplinary macro-areas, and data were aggregated.Open Access journals in JCR 2008 Social Sciences edition rank in the top fifty percentiles (0-50) with a 54.5% share.With substantial differences between macro-areas, in JCR 2008 Science edition Open Access journals rank in the top fifty percentiles (0-50) with a 38.62% share when considering Impact Factor, and with a 37.68% share referring to Immediacy Index. When considering 5-year Impact Factor, the share is 40.45%.Open Access journals are relatively new actors in the publishing market, and gaining reputation and visibility is a complex challenge. Some of them show impressive Impact Factor trends since their first year of tracking. The collected data show that the performance of Open Access journals, also tested with the most traditional bibliometric indicator, is quite good in terms of citations." ;

In this study we characterized for the first time the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene in river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and investigated its genetic variability. On a total of 78 buffaloes, 15 SNPs were detected and 6 of them were preliminarily genotyped. In particular, the g.133A>C SNP was found to create a new consensus site for the SP1 binding site, thus generating a new tandem repeat in the promoter region. A preliminary association study with the milk fatty acid content showed\nthat the C allele significantly affects the total desaturation index (P < 0.01). Linkage disequilibrium analysis allowed identification of 7 haplotypes and 4 tag SNPs. Such polymorphisms could represent\nuseful genetic markers for association studies with fatty acid composition, but further studies are needed to evaluate their potential use to improve the nutritional quality of the dairy products." ;

Nella prima parte del volume il lettore troverà i risultati cumulati del convergente impegno dell'archeologia, della linguistica e della storiografia tout court nel riconoscere le tracce di una millenaria permanenza accanto ai documentati rivolgimenti che di tempo in tempo sovvertono tutta l'area balcanica.\nCon una démarche del tutto conseguente, la nazione di cui si sono individuate le origini diviene nelle pagine seguenti la protagonista di una millenaria vicenda. Essa trascende i dati della politica e i problemi posti dalle complesse mescolanze di popoli e culture in Transilvania, Bucovina, Bessarabia e altri territori [...] fino a diventare all'inizio del ventesimo secolo un attore consapevole [...] La priorità del discorso sulla nazione rispetto a quello sulle articolazioni della società è anch'essa un non imprevedibile risultato é [...] di una riflessione che si colloca nella faticosa ricerca di un nuovo discorso scientifico sulla collettività romena [...]\"." ;

Current debate has been mainly focused on the role that mirror neurons and motor simulation may play in this process, with surprisingly little attention being devoted to how intentions are actually translated into movements. Here, we delineate an alternative approach to the problem of intention-from-movement understanding, which takes “action execution” rather than “action observation” as a starting point. We first consider whether and to what extent, during action execution, intentions shape movement kinematics. We then examine whether observers are sensitive to intention information conveyed by visual kinematics and can use this information to discriminate between different intentions. Finally, we consider the neural mechanisms that may contribute to intention-from-movement understanding. We argue that by reframing the relationship between intention and movement, this evidence opens new perspectives into the neurobiology of how we know other minds and predict others’ behavior." ;

The new genus, which is well characterized by an exclusive set of characters, comprises, at present, 26 species. Twenty species were formerly included in the genus Onthophagus and six were identified and here described as new species: Tiaronthophagus angolensis n.sp., T. jossoi n.sp., T. katanganus n.sp., T. rolandoi n.sp., T. saadaniensis n.sp., and T. zambesianus n.sp. A phylogenetic analysis that is based on a combined matrix, including discrete and landmark characters, was done. The landmark characters were tested using the geometric morphometrics techniques before their inclusion in the matrix. One single, fully resolved tree was obtained, with Tiaronthophagus constituting a distinct, monophyletic clade within Onthophagini, which was clearly separated from the other genera examined here. The biogeographical analysis identified the Central Africa as the ancestral area of the new genus and it mainly accounted for dispersal events leading to the present distribution. The generic rank that is assigned to the taxon is supported by the results of the morphological, phylogenetic, and biogeographical analyses, and by the comparison to the outgroups." ;

As ever, shared \nmemory programs are fairly easy to write and quite hard to optimise;  providing multi-core programmers with optimising tools and programming frameworks is a nowadays challenge. Few efforts have been done to support effective streaming applications on these architectures. In this paper we introduce FastFlow, a low-level programming framework based on lock-free queues explicitly designed to support high-level languages for streaming applications. We compare FastFlow with state-of-the-art programming frameworks such as Cilk, OpenMP, and Intel TBB. We experimentally demonstrate that FastFlow is always more efficient than all of them in a set of micro-benchmarks and on a real world application; the speedup edge of FastFlow over other solutions might be bold for fine grain tasks, as an example +35% on OpenMP, +226% on Cilk, +96% on TBB for the alignment of protein P01111 against UniProt DB using Smith-Waterman algorithm." ;

However, few studies have examined the incidence and risk factors for CR-KP bloodstream infection (BSI) among rectal carriers. To identify risk factors for CR-KP BSI among carriers, we performed a multicentre prospective matched case-control study of all adult CR-KP rectal carriers hospitalized in five tertiary teaching hospitals in Italy over a 2-year period. Carriers who developed CR-KP BSI were compared with those who did not develop subsequent BSI. Overall, 143 CR-KP BSIs were compared with 572 controls without a documented infection during their hospitalization. Multivariate analysis revealed that admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.59; p 0.03), abdominal invasive procedure (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.16-3.04; p 0.01), chemotherapy/radiation therapy (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.78-5.29; p <0.0001), and number of additional colonization sites (OR, 3.37 per site; 95% CI, 2.56-4.43; p <0.0001) were independent risk factors for CR-KP BSI development among CR-KP rectal carriers. A CR-KP BSI risk score ranging from 0 to 28 was developed based on these four independent variables. At a cut-off of ≥2 the model exhibited a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 93%, 42%, 29% and 93%, respectively. Colonization at multiple sites with CR-KP was the strongest predictor of BSI development in our large cohort of CR-KP rectal carriers" ;

However, clinicians and owners often show reluctance toward these invasive tests. However, molecular biology techniques are still not sensitive and specific enough to be regarded as a reliable tool for final diagnosis. In humans, flow cytometry (FC) allows a definitive diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma based on high prevalence of antigen aberrancies. We describe here the immunophenotype of 26 cases of suspect canine small-clear cell lymphoma, determined by multi-colour FC. All cases showed antigen aberrancies and therefore neoplasia was always confirmed. As a consequence, we argue that the combined use of cytology and FC allows solving the differential diagnosis between small clear cell lymphoma and non-neoplastic reactive conditions when histopathology is not available. Further studies are needed to establish if any aberrancy can be considered indicative of specific histotypes." ;

However, due to selective mortality and heterogeneous frailty, a population's tall stature may be more indicative of high selective pressures than of positive life conditions. This article examines stature in a biocultural context and draws parallels between bioarchaeological and living populations to explore the multidimensionality of stature variation in the past. This study investigates: 1) stature differences between archaeological populations exposed to low or high stress (inferred from skeletal indicators); 2) similarities in growth retardation patterns between archaeological and living groups; and 3) the apportionment of variance in growth outcomes at the regional level in archaeological and living populations. Anatomical stature estimates were examined in relation to skeletal stress indicators (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, linear enamel hypoplasia) in two medieval bioarchaeological populations. Stature and biocultural information were gathered for comparative living samples from South America. Results indicate 1) significant (P < 0.01) differences in stature between groups exposed to different levels of skeletal stress; 2) greater prevalence of stunting among living groups, with similar patterns in socially stratified archaeological and modern groups; and 3) a degree of regional variance in growth outcomes consistent with that observed for highly selected traits. The relationship between early stress and growth is confounded by several factors—including catch-up growth, cultural buffering, and social inequality. The interpretations of early life conditions based on the relationship between stress and stature should be advanced with caution" ;

Nevertheless, the impact of such treatment on other gaseous emissions during storage is not clear, since the studies performed so far have provided different scenarios.

The aim of the study was to investigate the association between preoperative US presentation and\naggressiveness features of MTC. Also, US features of MTC were compared with those previously reported.\nMethods: Study group comprised 134 MTC from nine different centers. Based on US presentation the nodules\nwere stratified in “at risk for malignancy” (m-MTC) or “probably benign” (b-MTC) lesions.\nResults: Eighty nine (66.4%) m-MTC and 45 (33.6%) b-MTC were found. Metastatic lymph nodes (p = 0.0001) and\nextrathyroid invasiveness (p < 0.0001) were more frequent in m-MTC. There was statistically significant correlation\n(p = 0.0002) between advanced TNM stage and m-MTC with an Odds Ratio 5.5 (95% CI 2.1–14.4). Mean postsurgical\ncalcitonin values were 224 ± 64 pg/ml in m-MTC and 51 ± 21 in b-MTC (p = 0.003).\nConclusions: This study showed that sonographically suspicious MTC is frequently associated with features of\naggressiveness, suggesting that careful preoperative US of MTC patients may better plan their surgical approach.\nKeywords: Medullary thyroid cancer, Ultrasonography, Histology, Thyroid nodule" ;

Meals and food becomes the favourite scenario for the allegorical moment. The meals have a direct relationship with the most essential and animal aspects of humain beings, with their ‘nature’; the meals are a very effective “device for the creation of sense” (Neumann), which refers to a very large spectrum of problematics, like the trasformation of nature in culture. Cultural actions like “good manners”, (i.e. the pervasive control of body and behaviour) oppose to the “animality” emerging from the vital function of nourishing.

Totally, 400 aphidicolin-induced breakages were analyzed from eight young and clinically healthy animals, four males and four females; these breakages were localized in 106 RBG-negative chromosome bands or at the band-interband regions. The number of breakages per chromosome did not vary statistically 'among' the animals investigated but the differences among individual chromosomes were highly significant thus indicating that the chromosomal distribution of the breakages is not random and appears only partially related to chromosome length. Fragile sites were statistically determined as those chromosomal bands showing three or more breakages. In the river buffalo karyotype, 51 fragile sites were detected and localized on the standardized ideogram of the species. The most fragile bands were as follows: 9q213 with 24 breakages out of 400; 19q21 with 16, 17q21 and inacXq24 with 15, 15q23 with 13 and 13q23 with 12 breaks, respectively.  Previous gene mapping analysis in this species has revealed that the closest loci to these fragile sites contain genes such as RASA1 and CAST (9q214), NPR3 and C9 (19q19), PLP and BTK (Xq24-q25), OarCP09 (15q24), and EDNRB (13q22) whose mutations are responsible for severe phenotypic malformations and immunodeficiency in humans as well as in mice and meat quality in pigs. Further cytogenetic and molecular studies are needed to fully exploit the biological significance of the fragile sites in karyotype evolution of domestic animals and their relationships with productive and reproductive efficiency of livestock." ;

In the Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt of central-eastern China, which is the largest UHP\nterrane in the world, the migmatitic North Dabie complex Zone (NDZ) stands out for the widespread anatexis\nthat widely overprinted the traces of eclogite-facies metamorphism, hampering a precise reconstruction of its\nP-T-(t) evolution.\nDifferent peak P-T conditions, varying between non-eclogitic to UHP conditions, have been proposed so far for\nvarious high-grade metamorphic rocks from the NDZ.

Methods and results:  Forty-two pure salivary duct carcinomas, 35 of which contained an in-situ component as defined by histological review and/or immunohistochemical analysis, were stained with antibodies for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and cytokeratin (CK) 5/6. Based on these markers, tumours were classified into HER2, luminal androgen receptor-positive, basal-like, luminal and indeterminate phenotype. Analysis revealed that 16.7\\%, 69\\%, 4.8\\%, 9.5\\% and 0\\% were of HER2, luminal androgen receptor-positive, basal-like, indeterminate and luminal phenotype, respectively. The in-situ and invasive components displayed the same molecular subtype in all but one case. Conclusions:  Salivary duct carcinomas can be classified into molecular subgroups approximately equivalent to those in the breast. We also report on the existence of a subgroup of bona fide pure salivary duct carcinomas that have a 'basal-like' phenotype. Understanding the phenotypic complexity of SDCs may help to expedite the identification of novel therapeutic targets for these aggressive tumours." ;

The aim of this prospective study was to assess the reliability and the safety of PICCs over a 5-year use in non-hospitalized cancer patients requiring long-term intravenous therapies.\nMethods\n\nSince June 2008, all adult oncology outpatient candidates for PICC insertion were consecutively enrolled and the incidence of catheter-related complications was investigated. The follow-up continued until the PICC removal.\nResults\n\nTwo hundred sixty-nine PICCs in 250 patients (98 % with solid malignancies) were studied, for a total of 55,293 catheter days (median dwell time 184 days, range 15–1,384). All patients received HPN and 71 % received chemotherapy during the study period. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) was low (0.05 per 1,000 catheter days), PICC-related symptomatic thrombosis was rare (1.1 %; 0.05 per 1,000 catheter days), and mechanical complications were uncommon (13.1 %; 0.63 per 1,000 catheter days). The overall complication rate was 17.5 % (0.85 per 1,000 catheter days) and PICCs were removed because of complications only in 7 % of cases. The main findings of this study were that, if accurately managed, PICCs can be safely used in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and/or HPN, recording a low incidence of CRBSI, thrombosis, and mechanical complications; a long catheter life span; and a low probability of catheter removal because of complications.\nConclusions\n\nOur study suggests that PICCs can be successfully utilized as safe and long-lasting venous access devices in non-hospitalized cancer patients." ;

Further aim was to define a plasma concentration cutoff value predicting an adequate response to therapy. Plasma concentrations were determined at the end of dosing interval (Ctrough) using an high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR. Ctrough levels were influenced by UGT1A1C>T rs887829, CYP1A1C>A rs2606345, CYP1A2A>C rs762551, CYP1A2C>T rs2470890 and MRP2G>A rs2273697 polymorphisms. A DFX plasma efficacy cutoff value of 20 000 ng ml-1 was identified; CYP1A1C>A rs2606345 AA and CYP1A2C>T rs2470890 TT genotypes may predict this value, suggesting a negative predictive role in therapy efficacy. Our data suggest the feasibility of a pharmacogenetic-based DFX dose personalization." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Objective: Dyslipidemia is one of the leading causes of death and cardiovascular morbidity in western countries. Some of these genetic disorders can be diagnosed in childhood through the evaluation of lipoprotein profile and DNA testing. Guidelines suggest the utility of an early selective screening in children/adolescents with a family history of dyslipidemia and/or premature cardiovascular disease. Aim of this study was to carry out the definite diagnosis of primitive lipoprotein disorders in children/adolescents who had been referred to our Lipid Clinic. Methods: we studied 288 children (age 10 ± 3.37 years) with a family history of dyslipidemia and/or premature cardiovascular disease. On the basis of the first level investigation (TC, HDL-C, triglycerides) results, subjects were divided in 3 phenotype groups including IIa, IIb, IV and a further  hypocholesterolemia group. Subsequently second level (apoB and apoA-I) and third level (Lipoprotein(a), ApoE gene polymorphism, DNA-based test and phytosterols dosage) investigations were performed. Results: on the basis of the first level analysis, patients were so divided: 76.7% IIa, 15.3% IIb, 6.9% IV, 1% hypocholesterolemia. We reached a definite diagnosis of primitive dyslipidemia in 95% of tested patients through second and third level investigations. 30.9% children resulted affected by Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), 30.6% by Familial Combined Hyperlipidaemia (FCHL), 14.1% by dominant hypercholesterolemia, 13.9% by Hyperlipoproteinemia(a), 3.9% by Familial Hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG), 1% by Hypocholesterolemia due to mutations in ApoB and PCSK9 genes, 0.6% by Hyperchylomicronemia attributable to LPL and ApoC-II defects and 0.3% by Phytosterolemia. Conclusion: this study remarks the importance of an early diagnosis of primitive lipoprotein disorders. When the suspect of primary dyslipemia is supported by first level analysis it is advisable performing second and third level investigations in order to reach a definite diagnosis and check the cardiovascular risk. Combining the proband atherogenic profile and family history allow to establish an adequate and personalized treatment approach, based on lifestyle intervention and, if needed,  dietary supplements and drugs since childhood/adolescence." ;

Total acid soluble carnitine fluctuates around the same levels in the brain, liver and muscle until 18th day of development, whereas it attains a peak on that day in the heart. At hatching compared to 18th day, it suddenly increases three times in the muscle, drops not significantly in the heart and brain, but sharply in the liver (-40%). However the levels are always higher than those of the grown chick in the brain but lower in the other tissues. 3. Free carnitine levels are almost constant in all tissues during the embryonic life; if compared to adult ones, they are very much lower in the liver, heart and muscle, but higher in the brain, even in 8 day-old chick. 4. Short chain esterified, carnitine reaches a maximum on 18th day of egg incubation in the liver, brain and heart; in the muscle it stays on constant levels until this day and then rapidly increases so that at hatching it doubles the values. 5.

Various studies havepointed to the utility of morphological and metrical traits in the mandible,such as symphyseal shape, gonial angle and eversion, and ramus flexureamong others in the assessment of biological sex. The research herepresented utilizes geometric morphometric techniques to investigate andquantify shape and size variation in the morphology of the mandibularcorpus and ascending ramus, and consequently highlights the potential forforensic human identification. The results of a novel morphometric studyare presented using clinical panoramic scanning x-radiography, the goal ofwhich was to develop a methodologically and statistically robust means ofinvestigating biological variation in lower jaw morphology from acommonly acquired clinical data source.As part of proof-of-concept, clinical digital orthopantogram images(OPG’s) were acquired from 50 male and 50 female adult participants froma modern Italian sample population. Ten type I and type II landmarks wereapplied to the symphyseal region and the condylar and coronoid processesof the resulting 2D images in order to anchor a framework of semilandmarkcurves. One-hundred equidistant semi-landmarks wereestablished along the inferior border of the corpus, and the posterior borderof the ascending ramus, thus encompassing the sympyseal region, gonialregion, and posterior ramus – all of which are isolated anatomical regionswhich have been demonstrated to exhibit significant expression of sexualdimorphism in previous studies. The resulting landmark and semilandmarkconfigurations were subjected to Generalized ProcrustesAnalysis (GPA) with Full Tangent Space Projection. Principal ComponentAnalysis (PCA) was applied in order to assess populational variation.Factor loadings were subject to Canonical Variates Analysis with stepwiseand leave-one-out classification in order to assess the effects of sexualdimorphism on mandibular shape. The preliminary results showedindividuals to be correctly classified for sex in 89.6% of cases (males werecorrectly classified in 90.1% of cases, and females in 85.6%).A partial least squares (2-block PLS) method was further applied, inorder to examine patterns of covariation between shape variables and theexploration of patterns of functional modularity. In this case, functionalmodules are assumed to be units within which there is a high degree ofintegration from many and/or strong interactions, but which are relativelyindependent of other such units. The nature of the interactions can be, forinstance, developmental, functional, or genetic, depending on the context.Most interestingly the results indicate the greatest level of individual andsex-specific variation is found in the shape-curve and pattern of the inferiorcorpus, in contrast to that of ramal flexure. However, a moderate degree ofmodular integration between the corporal and ramal regions suggests thatfunctional ties between the units are correlated in influencing sex-basedmorphological trait expression. Consequently such units may be studiedtogether or in isolation, and this may allow for the development ofidentification criteria based on modular unit shape variables which may be260 * Presenting Authorapplicable for both whole specimens and fragmented remains depending onthe forensic situation. Overall, the results are strongly significant andsuggest dependently and independently that the shape relationship betweenthe mandibular corpus and the ascending ramus offers significant power [...]" ;

        dcterms:abstract            "INTRODUCTION: Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock are common conditions with high mortality. Their early diagnosis in the Emergency Department (ED) is one of the keys to improving survival. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been used as a biomarker in septic patients but has limited specificity and can be elevated in other scenarios of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Soluble CD14 (sCD14) or presepsin is the free fragment of a glycoprotein expressed on monocytes and macrophages. Preliminary reports suggest that levels of presepsin are significantly higher in septic patients than in healthy individuals. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of presepsin compared to PCT in people presenting at the ED with SIRS and suspected sepsis or septic shock.\nMETHODS:\nThis study was conducted in two major hospitals in Turin, Italy. One hundred six patients presenting to the EDs with suspected sepsis or septic shock were included, and another eighty-three patients affected by SIRS, but with no clinical evidence of infection, were recruited as controls. Blood samples were collected at first medical evaluation and for some patients after 24 and 72 h. The samples were analyzed using the PATHFAST Presepsin assay for sCD14, and commercial kits were used for other determinations (for example, PCT). Definitive diagnosis and survival rates were obtained afterward by analysis of digital medical records.\nRESULTS:\nElevated concentrations of presepsin at presentation were observed in septic patients compared to control patients. The same trend was observed for mean values of PCT. Higher values of presepsin were observed in septic patients at presentation (time 0). The diagnostic accuracy of PCT was generally higher, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.875 for PCT and 0.701 for presepsin. Mean presepsin values were significantly higher in nonsurvivor septic patients (60-day mortality) than in survivors. No significant correlation was noted between PCT and survival.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIn our experience, presepsin was useful in the early diagnosis of infection in a complex population of patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock who presented to the ED. Presepsin showed a significant prognostic value, and initial values were significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality of patients affected by sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock." ;

Si tratta di una letteratura che si occupa di aspetti diversi delle condizioni  in cui si svolge il lavoro degli scienziati a partire dalla fine degli anni ’80-inizio anni ’90, fondamentalmente concorde nell’affermare che a partire da quel periodo si è generata una discontinuità  rispetto ai modi della produzione della conoscenza scientifica generalmente osservabili sino a quel momento.\nLe diverse prospettive in merito si sono generate spesso per differenziazione le une dalle altre, e presentano parecchi elementi in comune ma anche differenze significative. Può essere utile lavorare sugli elementi in comune. Il primo: l’evidente bisogno di segnalare una discontinuità nei modi della produzione della conoscenza scientifica. Il linguaggio utilizzato lo rivela sin troppo palesemente (scienza post-accademica; modo1, modo2, modo3, …), peraltro conducendo anche a immaginare nella forma di cesura passaggi che invece sono talvolta nella medesima letteratura descritti  come in corso e che sembrerebbero configurare la coesistenza di modi diversi di fare scienza piuttosto che la sostituzione di alcuni ad altri  (per intenderci: la scienza post-accademica ha cancellato la scienza accademica? Quella post-normale la normale? La scienza modo2 quella modo1?)\nIl secondo. Nell’insieme, dette teorie individuano un’area semantica che circoscrive il discorso sui cambiamenti intervenuti, in cui alcune parole  ritornano con insistenza. Proponiamo di considerarle parole chiave di questo discorso; si tratta di termini come mercato, pubblico, società civile, partecipazione, dialogo; sino, non senza retorica, alla democrazia della conoscenza come contestualizzazione della repubblica della scienza. \nIl testo utilizza poi alcune asserzioni della letteratura richiamata come termometro su cui misurare le esperienze di chi fa scienza." ;

Since then, urban neoliberalism has spread across the globalizing world through an increasing emphasis being laid on the entrepreneurialization of local government, the privatization of public services, and the commodification of urban space. In this context, urban neoliberalism has taken the form of a highly mobile government technology, giving rise to a tremendous variety of politico-economic regimes across the globe through processes of hybridization and variegation.

The case cohort consisted of adult inpatients whose hospital stay included at least one documented isolation of a KPC-Kp strain from a clinical specimen. For each case enrolled, we randomly selected two matched controls with no KPC-Kp-positive cultures of any type during their hospitalization. Matching involved hospital, ward, and month/year of admission, as well as time at risk for KPC-Kp isolation. A subgroup analysis was also carried out to identify risk factors specifically associated with true KPC-Kp infection.During the study period, KPC-Kp was isolated from clinical samples of 657 patients; 426 of these cases appeared to be true infections. Independent predictors of KPC-Kp isolation were recent admission to ICU, indwelling urinary catheter, central venous catheter (CVC), and/or surgical drain, ≥ 2 recent hospitalizations, hematological cancer, and recent fluoroquinolone and/or carbapenem therapy. Charlson Index ≥3, indwelling CVC, recent surgery, neutropenia, ≥2 recent hospitalizations, and recent fluoroquinolone and/or carbapenem therapy were independent risk factors for KPC-Kp infection. Models developed to predict KPC-Kp isolation and KPC Kp infection displayed good predictive power with the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.84) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.80-0.85), respectively.This study provides novel information, which might be useful for the clinical management of patients harboring KPC Kp and for controlling the spread of these organisms." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pulsed magnetic field therapy on peripheral nerve regeneration after median nerve injury and primary coaptation in the rat. Both median nerves were surgically exposed and denervated in 24 female Wistar rats. A microsurgical coaptation was performed on the right side, whereas on the left side a spontaneous healing was prevented. The study group underwent a daily pulsed magnetic field therapy; the other group served as a control group. The grasping force was recorded 2 weeks after the surgical intervention for a period of 12 weeks. The right median nerve was excised and histologically examined. The histomorphometric data and the functional assessments were analyzed by t-test statistics and one-way ANOVA. One-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant influence of group affiliation and grasping force (P = 0.0078). Grasping strength was higher on a significant level in the experimental group compared to the control group permanently from the 9th week to the end of the study. T-test statistics revealed a significantly higher weight of the flexor digitorum sublimis muscle (P = 0.0385) in the experimental group. The histological evaluation did not reveal any statistically significant differences concerning the histomorphometric parameters. Our results suggest that the pulsed magnetic field therapy has a positive influence on the functional aspects of neural regeneration. More studies are needed to precisely evaluate and optimize the intensity and duration of the application." ;

After establishing a theoretical background concerning the difficult distinction between borrowing and codeswitching (§ 1), the study analyzes the semantic, phonological and morphological integration of lexical borrowings in different languages of the corpus (§ 2). The core of the paper (§ 3) focuses on the relation between morphosyntactic and prosodic constraints of codeswitching in CorpAfroAs. Finally, the study argues (§ 4) that, even though syntactic constituency admittedly tells us a great deal about the types of boundaries where speakers are likely to codeswitch, prosodic segmentation plays a pivotal role in the definition of codeswitching. Furthermore, we will show that variation in intonation contours provides a good litmus test for telling the two phenomena of borrowing and codeswitching apart." ;

In that study I also addressed the case of 9/11 and the communicative steps that the Bush Administration took to establish a narrative of terror (Woodward, 2002; Westen, 2007: 349-376; Lakoff, 2008: 125-132) that since then has generated plenty of literature. \nAt the time of that research I was surprised by how quickly – 24 hours – the US were able to design and deliver such a compelling emotional narrative (Monahan, 2010: 95-116), coherent with the US country’s foreign policy agenda. At the same time I was also interested to understand why public opinion so easily “bought”  these self-explanatory, but also contradicting, “stories” that implied the necessity for a “global war”. In this way, rationality and a critical approach to the linguistic categories used to describe those and the following events, i.e. the Afghan war in 2001 and the Second Gulf War in 2003 (Høyer, 2008), were suspended. This study is an attempt to establish the connections, from a linguistic and cognitive point of view, between the pre and post 9/11 narratives to understand the conditions that made the latter a pre-emptive one." ;

A deletion/insertion polymorphism of 14-bp controls specific mRNA stability and protein levels of the HLAG. Different studies associate the HLA-G +14bp allele with lower mRNA levels and lower protein production. This polymorphism was analysed in 190 multiorgan cadaveric donors. Exon 8 ofHLA-Gwas amplified using specific primers and PCR products were sequenced with a 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Transplant outcome was analysed in 605 related recipients all transplanted at the Turin Transplant Centre. Transplants from donors with +14bp/+14bp genotype showed a better graft survival then those fromdonorswith otherHLA-Ggenotypes. It was highly significant in lung with 67% survival for +14bp/ +14bp genotype at five years after transplant vs 15% for other genotypes (Log-Rank Test P¼ 0.026). In kidney transplants, a slightly difference was noted (at 5 ys 91% vs 78; p: 0,09). Not significant differences in the heart and liver transplant were noted. This study evidenced that the influence of donor HLA-G genotype on survival diminish for transplant characterized by a worse prognosis such as HCV infections in liver or - in case of kidney recipients - PRA levels >50%, a second transplant and a higher number ofHLAMM.These results suggested that in the first post-transplant period the immunosuppressive treatments could be the main effectors against the acute rejection risk, independently by the HLA-G genotype. However, the +14bp/ +14bp donor genotypemay have a ‘‘protective’’ role against the chronic allograft damage which is mainly associated with endothelial cells injury. In fact, recent studies report that the immunosuppressive therapy is able alone to up-regulates soluble levels of HLA-G which induce apoptosis of endothelial cells binding to CD160 receptor." ;

Aside from the “toxic gumbo” produced by floodwaters, consequent environmental health hazards included: shortage of drinking water, chemical spills, sewage treatment, food contamination, waste disposal, infectious diseases, and transformation of eco-systems. However, to these unsanitary conditions one should add misappropriation of resources, racial inequality, and governmental and political inadequacies in dealing with this “incident of national significance,” which aggravated the already unhealthy management of an area that ultimately equaled to a war zone. In Dave Eggers’ non-fiction latest work, the description of Bush administration’s intervention sounds more like an invasion than a rescue, thus revealing all the disastrous aftermaths of what Henry A. Giroux defines as “the politics of disposability.” Although almost irritating in its hagiographic overtones, Eggers’ account of Abdulrahman Zeitoun's personal story is a powerful example of how ecocriticism can function as a “survival strategy.”" ;

Similarly to the liquid-gas phase transition, the nucleonic and the Δ-matter phase have a different isospin density in the mixed phase. In the liquid-gas phase transition, the process of producing a larger neutron excess in the gas phase is referred to as isospin fractionation. A similar effects can occur in the nucleon- Δmatter phase transition due essentially to a Δ- excess in the Δ-matter phase in asymmetric nuclear matter. In this context we also discuss the relevance of Δ-isobar degrees of freedom in the bulk properties and in the maximum mass of compact stars." ;

We generated the model starting from a dataset of all locations where this species’ presence was confirmed for the region of piedmont in 2004–2010, which consisted of only 15 occurrence records. To verify the working hypothesis that population survival is higher in areas where Maxent identifies higher distribution probability values, we used suitability indexes generated by the model to compare the “historical” (before 1980) and “recent” (1980–1996) distributions of P. f. insubricus populations in the piedmont region. The average area-under-the-curve value (0.878, s = 0.075) of the Maxent model proved significantly informative. Using the Bonferroni confidence interval, we demonstrated that surviving populations occupy geographic areas characterized by significantly higher potential suitability (p < 0.05), and we selected areas accordingly. We therefore conclude that, in our case study, modelling the distribution of rare species may represent a useful strategy to select areas where these species are likely to persist. To further evaluate this approach, we suggest testing it on the study of other rare species." ;

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the treatments most commonly used for major depressive disorder. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of major depressive disorder in two Italian regional settings, ie, Veneto and Sardinia.\nMethods\nA decision analytic model was adapted from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency to reflect current clinical practice in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the most significant Italian regions. This adaptation was possible as a result of collaboration with an expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists. The population comprised patients with a first diagnosis of major depressive disorder and initiating one SSRI or SNRI drug for the first time. The time frame used was 12 months. Efficacy and utility data for the model were retrieved from the literature and validated by the expert panel. Local data were used for resource utilization and for treatment costs based on the perspective of each regional health service. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model.\nResults\nBase case analysis showed that escitalopram is associated with the largest health gain (in quality-adjusted life years) and a lower total cost at one year for Sardinia (except for sertraline, against which it was cost-effective) and for Veneto, and therefore dominates the other treatment strategies, given that more quality-adjusted life years are achieved at a lower total cost. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the model.\nConclusion\nThe results indicate that escitalopram is the most cost-effective pharmacologic treatment strategy for both regional health services compared with all SSRIs and all SNRIs used in the first-line treatment of major depressive disorder." ;

The authors report 22 cases of sinonasal tumors: 7 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 adenoid-cystic carcinomas, 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma, 6 adenocarcinomas, 1 esthesioneuroblastoma, 1 osteosarcoma, 1 small-cell sarcoma and finally 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. No significant differences were observed between CT and MR staging: 2 T2 and 15 T4 lesions were diagnosed in the maxillary sinuses and 3 stage-II and 1 stage-III lesions in the naso-ethmoidal region. Tumor spread was similar in 20/22 cases: MRI excluded the involvement of maxillary and sphenoid sinuses in 2 cases. CT was superior in the assessment of bone destruction particularly at the base of the skull, but MRI better demonstrated intracranial spread. MRI detailed the intraorbital muscles and, in the infratemporal fossa, the pterygoid muscles better than CT. High agreement was observed between CT and histology in 5/7 cases and between MRI and histology in 6/7 cases undergoing craniofacial resection. Seventeen of 22 cases had low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted, PD and T2-weighted MR images. Signal was hyperintense in 5 cases: 1 adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, 3 adenoid-cystic carcinomas and 1 esthesioneuroblastoma. In agreement with literature data, this study confirms CT as the examination of choice in staging sinonasal tumors: nonetheless, MRI yields valuable information in the cases with tumor spread to the muscles and soft tissues." ;

Furthermore HDL-C represent an important biochemical marker related to overweight/obesity and to CVD risk in adults. Aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between lipid biochemical markers (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, apoB and apoA-I levels) and the staturo-ponderal growth in a cohort of dyslipidemic children.\nStudy design. A cohort of 231 patients (aged  10.9±3.7 years) was enrolled. Seventy-six children resulted affected by FH, 68 by FCHL and 87 by dominant Hypercholesterolemia. Demographic data, medical history, physical examination and two generations family history of cardiovascular events were evaluated in the entire cohort. Children were submitted to biochemical analysis concerning TC, HDL-C, TG, apoB and apoA-I by standard methods, after an overnight fasting. Statistical analysis: Pearson correlation analysis was performed. \nResults. HDL-C resulted negatively correlated to BMI (r=-0.300, p<0.001), TG ApoB/ApoA1 (p<0.001) and positively correlated to TC and ApoA1 (p<0.001). Furthermore BMI resulted positively correlated to age and TG (p<0.001) and negatively to ApoA1. (p=0.048).  \nConclusion. The present findings indicate that HDL-C represent a significant parameter to check in children particularly when overweight occur." ;

In a group of 600 cirrhotic patients 64 had HCC, which was confirmed at histology in 24 cases, and by disease evolution in the other 40; single focal degeneration was proven in 40 patients, multiple (2, 3 focal lesions), or diffuse degeneration (more than 3 focal lesions) in the remaining 24. Sixteen patients had associated portal thrombosis. US recognized 38/40 single HCC, 22/24 multiple or diffuse lesions, and 11/16 portal vein thromboses. Degeneration was most frequently hypo/isoechoic in small tumors, hyperechoic and mixed in large lesions. When small lesions are hyperechoic their differentiation from both hemangiomas and regeneration noduli is extremely difficult. In such cases CT is mandatory. US diagnostic accuracy is by far superior to that of CT: 95% vs 85% in single lesions and 91.6% vs 87.5% in diffuse forms. Overall accuracy is 93.7% for US and 85.9% for CT. The authors believe that US should be performed every 6 months on cirrhotic patients, so as to allow HCC to be detected in time for radical surgery, while CT should be performed only when doubts persist." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "PURPOSE: To devise and implement a programme of measurements to assess the entrance surface dose for a standard-sized patient and to check the compliance with diagnostic reference levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dose evaluation was performed on 40 radiographic instruments. The exposure parameters were collected for the main radiographic procedures (chest, skull, spine, pelvis, abdomen) each performed with instrument on a standard-sized patient. The output of each X-ray tube at 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 and 120 kV was measured with a solid state detector during quality controls. Beam quality and geometric characteristics of the equipment were also determined. The entrance surface dose for a standard patient was assessed for each procedure carried out with the 40 instruments, thus obtaining a total of 155 radiographic techniques. Finally, the method was validated by comparing the values obtained with the solid state and an ionization chamber for X-ray beam detector. RESULTS: The comparison between the solid state detector and the ionisation chamber demonstrated a good agreement. Results show that reference diagnostic levels are respected in most examinations (147/155) even if exposure values do not always comply with those indicated by European guidelines. The measurement programme seems to be applicable in hospital practice where the large number of radiographics instruments and procedures requires the acquisition and processing of a large number of data. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of patient dose during quality control is feasible and allows a first check of compliance with reference levels in order to identify which procedures can be optimised by means of more specific measurements and assessments." ;

Lymphocytes were the predominant cell type, in pleural fluid, in neoplastic pleural effusions as well as in congestive heart failure pleural effusions and, especially, in tuberculous pleural effusions. Lymphocyte analysis in pleural fluid and in peripheral blood suggests the involvement of different mechanisms for the lymphocyte accumulation in the pleural space according to different etiologies. Tuberculous pleural effusions showed an evident CD4+ and TEC T5.9+ lymphocyte accumulation from peripheral blood. In these patients, cutaneous skin test response to purified protein derivative was strongly related to this situation. In neoplastic pleural effusions there was a lower percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes, reflecting circulating lymphocyte pool; however, in neoplastic pleural effusions, various lymphocyte patterns may be sometimes observed depending on different histologies. Passive lymphocyte accumulation seems to be the most important mechanism in congestive-heart-failure pleural effusions.\n\nPMID:\n    1677776\n    [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]" ;

Methods and results: We used multiple independent data sources to identify 25,570 adults with type 2 diabetes residing in Turin, Italy, as of 1 July 2003. Data extracted from administrative data databases were used to create four care models ranging in organization from highly structured care (integrated primary and specialist care) to progressively less structured care (unstructured care). Regression analyses, adjusted for main confounders, were applied to examine the differences between the models in direct costs, mortality, and diabetes-related hospitalizations rates over a 4-year period. In patients managed according to the unstructured care model (i.e., usual care by a primary care provider and without strict guidelines adherence), excess of all-cause mortality was 84% and 4-year direct cost was 8% higher than in those managed according to the highly structured care model. Cost ratio analysis revealed that the major cost driver in the unstructured care model was hospital admissions, which were 31% higher than the rate calculated for the more structured care models. In contrast, spending on prescription medications and specialist consultations was higher in the highly structured care model. Conclusion: A diabetes care model that integrates primary and specialty care, together with practices that adhere to guideline recommendations, was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and hospitalizations, as compared with less structured models, without increasing direct health costs. © 2014 Elsevier B.V." ;

The homogeneous principal symbol is not smooth on the whole co-sphere bundle but only admits directional limits at the north-poles, encoded by a principal angular symbol. Furthermore there is a limit-family for \tau\to+infty. Ellipticity permits to construct parametrices that are inverses for large values of the parameter. We then obtain sub-calculi of Toeplitz type with a corresponding symbol structure. In particular, we discuss  \ninvertibility of operators of the form P_1A(\tau)P_0 where both P_0 and P_1 are zero-order projections and A(\tau) is a usual parameter-dependent operator of arbitrary order or A(\tau)=\tau^{mu}-A with a pseudodifferential operator A of positive integer order mu." ;

Peripheral blood was drawn from 3 healthy cows, and cultured in duplicate for 72 hours in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10 % FBS, L-glutamine, antibiotic-antimicotic, and Concanavalin-A. After 36 hours from the initiation, BrdU (Sigma) was added to the cultures, respectively at 10 μg/ml and 300 μg/ml (f.c.). Slides were stained with acridine orange solution (0.010 % in Sorensen buffer, pH=7.0). 20 metaphases were analyzed for each animal, for each dosage, with a total of 3,523 chromosomes. The mean rate of SCE/cell was 5.85 ± 2.71 at the dosage of 10 μg/ml while it increased up to 33.93 ± 13.03 at the dosage of 300 μg/ml. The fraction of chromosomes ‘with’ exchanges was only 9 % at the dosage of 10, while it increased up to 41.51 % at the dosage of 300. The exchanges (SCEs) observed at 10 μg/ml were of type 1 (8.84%), type 2(0.42 %) and type 3 (0.03 %), whereas at 300 μg/ml many more exchanges were observed as follows: type 1 (29.10 %), type 2 (9.54 %), type 3 (1.98 %), type 4 (0.77 %), type 5 (0.09 %) and type 6 (0.03 %). By increasing the BrdU final concentration from 10 to 300 μg/ml , the total number of exchanges visualized rised from 354 at 1,462 (4.13 times). These results encourage further insights into the SCE studies at high dosages of BrdU in order to better characterize the genome stability in the livestock species and breeds engaged in animal production." ;

La sua funzione più nota è senz’altro l’attività antimicrobica contro molte specie patogene, esplicata sia attraverso meccanismi diretti che indiretti. È ormai noto che singoli polimorfismi a livello del gene LTF possono influenzare la funzionalità della proteina, modificandone la sua capacità battericida. Nella specie umana ad esempio, sono state individuate e caratterizzate due varianti che differiscono per l’attività battericida\ncontro specie Gram-positive coinvolte in patologie periodontali.Nella specie caprina, un test condotto su E. coli O111 ha dimostrato che alcune capre originarie della Corea producono una lattoferrina con una maggiore attività antibatterica rispetto a quella di capre Saanen (Lee et al., 1997). Particolare attenzione pertanto va dedicata a tutti i marcatori che si ritrovano nei geni coinvolti nella resistenza alle infezioni, come microsatelliti e SNPs. Il presente lavoro riporta l’individuazione, nella specie caprina, di un microsatellite al locus della lattoferrina (LTF), e valuta la sua naturale variabilità in alcune popolazioni allevate nell’Italia meridionale." ;

At the moment the best therapeutic option for treating this tumour is surgical resection, but chemoprevention is very important in preventing metastasis and tumour spread. The process of metastatization is due to cell migration through blood vessels or lymphatic vessels and involves several adhesion molecules. The key role played by adhesion molecules has been suggested by the observation that colon carcinomas cells, derived from patients, express an increased level of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 (1, 2); moreover, several data have also demonstrated that the ability of metastatization of colon cancer cells is directly linked to the ability of the cells to bind the CD62E (3). On the base of these observations we propose that drugs that inhibit the adhesive activity of cancer cells may be helpful tools in preventing metastasis formation. Our experiments have been performed on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), providing a simplified model to mimic the tissue microvascular circulation which is involved in the interactions with tumours cells (1).  Our recent experiments have shown that the fusion molecule human ICOS-mouse Ig, a stimulator of B7h receptor (membrane receptor belonging to the B7 family and expressed by activated T cell) is able to reduce the adhesion of human polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to HUVEC" ;

In four myeloma patients and one benign monoclonal gammopathy, we also observed T lymphocytes bearing receptors idiotypically cross-reactive with the monoclonal protein. The values ranged from 1.8 to 8.0% within the purified T-cell population. In a first hypothesis, these T lymphocytes can belong to the tumoral clone itself. The tumoral event must occur at the level of a common precursor not yet determined to B or T pathway of differentiation.

A total of 159 and 144 in vitro-matured MII oocytes of the Italian Friesian and Italian Brown breeds, respectively, were obtained according to the standard methods and analyzed by FISH using \"Xcen\" and \"5\" chromosome-specific painting probes, produced by chromosome microdissection and Degenerate Oligonucleotide Primer- Polymerase Chain Reaction (DOP-PCR). Oocytes with unreduced chromosome number were 10.1% and 16.7% in the two breeds, respectively. To avoid bias due to possible artifacts, the aneuploidy rates were determined by analyzing only oocytes with the corresponding polar bodies. In the Italian Friesian, 100 of 143 (69.9%) secondary MII oocytes showed clear MII plates with corresponding first polar bodies and were scored for aneuploidy detection; one oocyte was \"nullisomic\" for chromosome X (1.0%) and one \"disomic\" for chromosome 5 (1.0%). In the Italian Brown, 100 of 120 (83.3%) MII oocytes with corresponding first polar bodies were analyzed; one oocyte was nullisomic (1.0%) and one was disomic (1.0%), both for chromosome 5. Totally, 303 oocytes were analyzed, 40 of which showed an unreduced chromosome complement (13.2%); of 200 MII oocytes with the corresponding first polar bodies, the aneuploidy rate (nullisomy+disomy) for the two chromosomes scored was 2%. Assuming that each chromosome is equally involved in aneuploidy, it results that in cattle oocytes matured in vitro, at least 30% of the oocytes (1x30 haploid chromosomes) should be aneuploid. Premature separation of sister chromatids (PSSC) was also observed in 2% of the oocytes in the Italian Friesian breed involving chromosome 5 and in 1% of the Italian Brown breed involving the X chromosome. Estimation of the \"baseline\" level of aneuploidy in the in vitro-matured oocytes of the various domestic animal species and breeds is, to our opinion, a useful reference for improving the in vitro production of embryos as well as for monitoring future trends of the reproductive health of the species/breeds engaged in zootechnical productions, especially in relation to management errors and environmental hazards" ;

Proangiogenic peptides binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (i.e. VEGFs and FGFs) are released by several cell types, including ECs and tumor cells. Proangiogenic intracellular signalling cascades involve many messengers working in a sort of network. In particular, in this chapter, we describe the properties and functions of the intracellular calcium signals (Cai), a universal, evolutionary conserved and highly versatile pathway involved in the regulation of EC proliferation and migration.\nAngiogenic factors generate Cai rises via two mechanisms: entry from extracellular medium, through the opening of calcium-permeable channels in the plasmamembrane, or release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. Calcium entry, the main topic of this chapter, can be dependent on previously InsP3-activated emptying of calcium stores (store- operated Ca2+ entry - SOCE), or independent on it (non store-operated Ca2+ entry - NSOCE). The intracellular pathways underlying endothelial Ca2+ entry involve, among the other pathways, arachidonic acid (AA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. Even if some Ca2+ entry blockers are under clinical trial with encouraging results, a better knowledge about the molecular nature of proangiogenic Ca2+ channels and their intracellular regulation in healthy and pathological processes could lead to new and more powerful strategies in the therapeutical approaches aimed to interfere with altered tissue vascularization. Here, we discuss the state of the art in the field of calcium signaling and angiogenesis, the related recent literature and patents." ;

Avogadro” University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy \n\nCamptothecin (CPT) is a pentacyclic quinoline alkaloid that exerts a potent DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitor effect with anti-tumor activity in hematological and solid tumors.  However, its clinical use is prevented by major limitations such as poor solubility and hydrolysis. Some camptothecin analogs, either semi-synthetic or synthetic such as topotecan and irinotecan, have been used in cancer therapy. An alternative approach is to take advantage by nanomedicine that has enormous potentials in improving drug availability, stability and decreasing side effects. In this line, here, we evaluated whether β-cyclodextrin-based nanosponge carriers can overcome CPT chemical disadvantages and improve the in vitro anti-tumor efficacy in androgen refractory (DU145 and PC-3 cell lines) and androgen sensitive (LNCaP cell line) models of prostate cancer. HPLC analysis, performed on the cell pellet after treatment with CPT-loaded β-cyclodextrin nanosponge (CN-CPT), revealed that CPT concentration increased over time indicating a prolonged release of the drug. Moreover, CN-CPT inhibited Topoisomerase I activity, induced DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, indicating that the CN-CPT formulation does not affect activity of the drug. CN-CPT exerted an increased anti-tumor activity, in both cell line models, as compared to CPT. Moreover, Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining showed an induction of cell death at low concentrations that were not effective for CPT. LNCaP cells were less sensitive to both CPT and CN-CPT, than PC-3 and DU145 cells, but CN-CPT always exerted higher antiproliferative activity and DNA damage ability than CPT. Moreover in LNCaP cells, CN-CPT treatment inhibited expression of the androgen receptor at doses that were ineffective for CPT. To evaluate the antimetastatic activity of CPT, in vitro experiments of tumor cell adhesion to HUVECs and cell motility were performed. Results showed that CN-CPT was effective at lower doses than CPT and irinotecan in inhibiting cell adhesion and motility. HUVEC treatment with CPT or CN-CPT did not modulate surface expression of adhesion molecules. Finally, the anti-tumor effect of CN-CPT was tested in vivo using PC3-xenograft SCID/beige mice and results confirmed a significant improvement of antitumoral activity of CN-CPT as compared to CPT.\nTaken together, these results support the use of the β-cyclodextrin nanosponge technology to deliver anticancer drugs for the treatment of both androgen sensitive and refractory prostate cancers." ;

In particular, mesenchymal stem cells were shown to ameliorate renal function and recovery after acute damage. We here evaluated the protective effect and localization of CD133(+) renal progenitors from the human inner medulla in a model of glycerol-induced acute tubular damage and we compared the results with those obtained with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. We found that CD133(+) progenitor cells promoted the recovery of renal function, preventing tubular cell necrosis and stimulating resident cell proliferation and survival, similar to mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, by optical imaging analysis, CD133(+) progenitor cells accumulated within the renal tissue, and a reduced entrapment in lung, spleen, and liver was observed. Mesenchymal stem cells were detectable at similar levels in the renal tissue, but a higher signal was present in extrarenal organs. Both cell types produced several cytokines/growth factors, suggesting that a combination of different mediators is involved in their biological action. These results indicate that human CD133(+) progenitor cells are renotropic and able to improve renal regeneration in acute kidney injury." ;

In the present study, we report the partial structure of the gene coding for the MBL in sheep and goat as well as the analysis of their promoters. By using as template genomic DNA from leukocytes obtained from individual blood samples we sequenced from -961 nt of the promoter to the 397th nt of the 4th exon of four sheep (EMBL Acc. no. AM933378) and from -978 nt to the 471th nt of the 4th exon of four goats (EMBL Acc. no. AM933377), for a total of 4461 bp and 4515 bp, respectively. By comparing the homologous sequence of the bovine MBL gene (EMBL Acc. no. NC007327), it was possible to determine the size of the exons, similar in both investigated species: 200 bp (exon 1), 117 bp (exon 2), and 69 bp (exon 3). The comparison of the sequences between goat and sheep shows an homology of 92.2%. The differences are due essentially to insertions/deletions at intronic level: the sheep presents with respect to the goat a deletion at the 1st intron of 11 nt, two insertions at the 2nd intron, respectively of 29 and 41 nt, and at the 3rd intron a stretch of eight Guanine in the goat vs. eight Thymine in the sheep. The length of the three introns was 395 bp vs. 385 (intron 1), 1278 bp vs. 1347 (intron 2), and 1028 bp vs. 1019 (intron 3) respectively in goat and sheep. For both species, all the splice junctions follow the common role 5'GT/ 3'AG. The ORF (Open Reading Frame) encodes for 249 amino acid residues, whereas the leader peptide is composed by 19 amino acids. The starting codon (ATG, Methionine) is located between the 10th and the 12th nt of the 1st exon, while the stop codon (TGA) between the 372th and the 374th nt of the 4th exon. While from the comparison of the exonic sequences, 23 SNPs were identified, 10 of which give rise to an amino acidic change. The sequence analysis of the promoter region in sheep shows the presence of the following putative binding sites for transcription factors: TATA-box (ATAAA) and CCAAT-box (CCAAAT) in position -49 and -140 nt, respectively. Furthermore, two glucocorticoid responsive elements (GRE) were identified: in position -765 (AGATCAGA) and -971 (ACTGATCT). The promoter analysis for goat was found to be analogous to that of sheep but it shows the disappearance of the regulatory site GRE (ACTGATCT). Further studies need to be performed in order to verify whether the markers identified in the present study can be associated to the resistance to pathogens such as Brucella melitensis by carrying out suitable test for antimicrobial activity." ;

Dynamic secretion of PRL and TSH was also evaluated, in order to identify the persistence of any underlying abnormality of hypothalamic pituitary control and to predict relapses. A relapse into hyperprolactinaemia was shown in 36% of patients 5-90 months (mean 46) after surgery. This was accompanied by reappearance of clinical symptoms but not by the radiological demonstration of the adenoma in any patients. A significant PRL rise after domperidone, a dopaminergic antagonist drug, was shown in cured patients after surgery (mean +/- SEM peak, 2977 +/- 645 mU/l) but this was markedly lower than that observed in control subjects (5732 +/- 440 mU/l). In fact, normal PRL increments were shown in only 6/16 (37%) patients. TSH hyper-responsiveness to domperidone normalized in only 46% of patients. Similar PRL responses to those obtained with domperidone were shown when a TRH test was given. A relapse into hyperprolactinaemia was observed in six of ten (60%) non-responders to domperidone and in four of seven (57%) non-responders to TRH, whereas six normal responders to domperidone and TRH had not relapsed at that time. Plasma PRL levels during pregnancy showed increments lower than those observed in normal pregnant women only in domperidone and TRH non-responder patients. These results indicate that a relapse into hyperprolactinaemia and a blunted PRL rise during pregnancy were present only in patients with persistently reduced PRL response to dynamic tests." ;

Le linee guida dell’American Psychiatric Association (2001, 2005) suggeriscono un approccio farmacologico mirato alle principali dimensioni sintomatologiche del disturbo. La review sistematica della Cochrane Collaboration (2010) conclude che, accanto agli stabilizzatori dell’umore e agli acidi grassi omega-3, l’impiego dei nuovi antipsicotici è supportato da evidenze di efficacia. A partire dal 2006, il nostro gruppo di ricerca ha condotto studi clinici in aperto per valutare l’efficacia di alcuni antipsicotici di seconda generazione (quetiapina, aripiprazolo e paliperidone) nel trattamento del DBP. La quetiapina si è rilevata efficace sui sintomi ansiosi, sull’impulsività e sugli accessi di rabbia, mentre l’aripiprazolo e il paliperidone sono risultati utili nel ridurre l’impulsività e i sintomi cognitivo-percettivi. Recentemente, abbiamo condotto uno studio randomizzato-controllato per confrontare l’efficacia e la tollerabilità dell’asenapina, antipsicotico da poco introdotto in commercio rispetto all’olanzapina, farmaco estesamente studiato nel DBP. Un gruppo di pazienti con diagnosi di DBP è stato assegnato a due tipi di trattamento per 12 settimane: asenapina 5 mg b.i.d. versus olanzapina 10 mg/die. I risultati mostrano che entrambi i farmaci risultano efficaci sui sintomi specifici del DBP, sull’impulsività, sulle condotte autolesive, sui sintomi d’ansia, sulla gravità globale dei sintomi e sul funzionamento socio-lavorativo, mentre non si rileva un miglioramento significativo dei sintomi depressivi e dell’aggressività. Dal confronto dei due farmaci emergono limitate differenze di efficacia che riguardano particolari sintomi del DBP: l’asenapina è più efficace sull’instabilità affettiva, l’olanzapina sui sintomi cognitivo-percettivi. Gli effetti collaterali sono complessivamente di entità moderata, ma sono di tipo sensibilmente diverso per i due farmaci" ;

Thanks to the stents, esophageal strictures could be dilated, significantly reducing dysphagia and allowing the patients to return on to a solid diet. Radiological and endoscopic exams proved the efficacy of the stents in all but 2 patients in whom the tumors had invaded the stent lumen and caused obstruction. In all cases the stents were highly biocompatible and well tolerated. Neither major complications, such as perforation or bleeding, were observed, nor minor ones, such as fever or migration from the site of implant, which may occur with plastic prostheses. To conclude, self-expanding metallic stents used in clinical trials for 13 months proved an effective method in the palliative treatment of malignant esophageal strictures." ;

Camptothecin (CPT) and its derivates are unique in their ability to inhibit DNA Topoisomerase, by stabilizing a covalent reaction intermediate termed the cleavable complex which ultimately causes tumor cell death. In clinical it is widely believed that camptothecin analogs exhibited remarkable anti-tumor and anti-leukemia activity. Application of camptothecin in clinic is limited due to serious side effects and high degradability and weak solubility. At present, some  camptothecin analogs, either semi-synthetic or synthetic drug based on camptothecin, have been applied in cancerous therapy such as topotecan and irinotecan, while others have been obtained satisfying  curative effects in clinic. In the present study a new formulation of CPT embedded in b-cyclodextrin-based nanosponges has been evaluated on prostate cancer models.

Our aim was to collect homogeneous results in a large series of patients, evaluating both the technical and the clinical success with a long-term follow-up (1 month-13 years). One thousand three hundred forty seven PTRA procedures (including 42 restenoses) in 1,073 patients were retrospectively reviewed. In 807 cases the cause of stenosis was atherosclerosis, in 442 cases fibromuscular dysplasia and in 24 cases arteritis in 12 cases, stenoses were present in patients that had undergone a surgical by-pass. Sixty-two stenoses in patients with solitary kidney and 102 in patients with renal failure were studied separately. The technical success (based on the morphology of the dilated tract) obtained in 91% of cases was considered, together with the clinical success (in 81% of cases), based on the decrease in blood pressure evaluated according to Martin's classification. The blood pressure values collected after the maneuver were also evaluated separately for the different types of stenosis etiology: atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia or arteritis; moreover, blood pressure was studied in solitary kidney patients and in those with renal failure. Complications were classified as major (4.2%) and minor (4.9%). The high success rate and the low incidence of complications we observed in our series suggest PTRA as the procedure of choice for high blood pressure patients with renal artery stenosis > 50% of the normal caliber." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Objective: Atherosclerosis starts in childhood although clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD) do not usually emerge before middle age. Clinical studies have established that elevated cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (Tg) levels, low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and raised Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels are associated with increased CVD risk. Measurements of TC, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL-C are widely recommended for CVD risk assessment. However many studies in adults have demonstrated that apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and their ratio have a greater prognostic value than LDL-C. Furthermore, it is increasingly being recognized that the non-HDL-C level is a simple and accurate index of CVD risk. Aim of the study was the evaluation of TC, LDL-C, apoB and apoA-I levels, apoB/apoA-I ratio and non-HDL-C in a cohort of children affected by primary dyslipidemia, divided in two groups according  to the family history of CVD. \nMethods: we studied 285 children aged 10.04 ± 3.34 years (89 FH, 88 FCHL, 54 dominant Hypercholesterolemia, 40 Hyperlipoprotein(a), 11 Familial hypertriglyceridemia, 2 Hyperchilomicronemia,  1 Phytosterolemia) with a family history of dyslipidemia and/or premature cardiovascular disease and 74 controls (age 9.35 ± 4.71 years). TC, HDL-C, Tg, apoB and apoA-I were evaluated after an overnight fasting. LDL-C was estimated usig the Friedewald formula while non-HDL-C was calculated as TC minus HDL-C. Patients were divided in two groups according to a positive (group 1) or negative (group 2) family history of CVD.\nResults: dyslipidemic children showed TC, LDL-C, apoB, apoB/apoA-I ratio and non-HDL-C levels significantly higher (p<0.001) than controls.\nWe found differences of non-HDL-C and apoB/apoA-I ratio levels comparing the two groups of patients, however they only approached the statistical significance resulting p=0.085 and p=0.06 respectively. Any difference of TC, LDL-C and apoB was detected.\nConclusion: The present findings indicate the prognostic value of childhood apoB/apoA-I ratio and non-HDL-C levels in evaluating CVD risk. Measurement of apolipoproteins (apoB and possibly apoA-I) should be routinely added to the standard lipid profile (TC, Tg, HDL-C) to assess the atherogenic potential of lipid disorders. This is particularly relevant to dyslipidemias characterized by an elevation in plasma triglycerides. The apoB/ApoA-I ratio and non-HDL-C represent an advantage over traditional lipid variables for risk prediction and especially apoB could also replace the standard ‘lipid profile’ as a target for therapy in at-risk patients." ;

Recently, the interest for this species increased also in European countries, mainly because of its meat and milk characteristics. Furthermore, it is a species well adapted to marginal conditions and it could be used to preserve mountain territories economy. We carried out a detailed investigation on this species with the following main aims: 1) to perform a cytogenetic screening of a yak herd recently introduced in Italy; 36 out of 60 animals were analyzed by conventional and GTG-banding karyotype. All animals were 2n=and no chromosomal abnormalities were found, confirming that the introduced herd is a good nucleus to start up with yak farming in Italy; 2) to determine the genetic stability of the animals reared under Italian conditions; two different tests were used: “Chromatid/chromosome breaks” and “Sister chromatid exchange (SCE)”. Out of 400 analyzed cells, 3.75% showed one or more anomalies; the most represented were chromosome and chromatid breaks. The mean number of SCE/cells was 5.2%. Comparison with cattle revealed that the two species have the same percentage of chromosome anomalies, while SCE frequency is lower in yak compared to cattle; 3) to increase the cytogenetic knowledge about this species and compare Bos taurus and Bos grunniens in relation to male sterility of F1 hybrids; C-, R-, and G-banded karyotypes of yak were prepared and compared with the standard karyotypes of cattle. To identify Nucleolar Organizer Regions, sequential NOR’s/R banded karyotypes were performed. Despite the two species share a very high degree of banding homology, some differences can be pointed out; the most remarkable is on the centromeric region of chromosome 15, where a strong positive band is present in Bos grunniens while absent in Bos taurus. Molecular data indicate that in yak, unlike in cattle, the X chromosome has retained a homologous sequence (182 bp) to the Y chromosome. To verify if larger blocks of chromatin are involved, FISH analysis of yak metaphases using X and Y cattle painting probe was performed. The lack of unspecific signal indicated that no large blocks of chromatin are interested. Finally, we mapped two genes (SRY: sex-determining region Y gene and ZFY: zinc finger protein, Y-linked) on the yak Y chromosome to verify if this chromosome, like in other species, such as Bos indicus, underwent rearrangement during evolution. The two genes mapped at the same position compared to cattle, indicating that the sterility of F1 hybrids seems not to be due to Y chromosomal rearrangements relatively to the these two genes." ;

More than 50 000 sperm nuclei from 11 subjects (5 and 6, respectively for each breed) have been analyzed by the fluorescent in situ hybridization with the Xcen and Y-chromosome specific painting probes. The fraction of X- and Y-bearing sperm was close to the 1:1 ratio in the Modicana breed, whereas in the Agerolese the Y-fraction was significantly higher (P < 0.002) compared to the X-counterpart. The mean rates of X-Y aneuploidy were 0.510 and 0.466%, respectively, in the two breeds; no significant differences were found among individual bulls within each breed. Average frequencies of disomic and diploid sperm were 0.425 and 0.085% in the former and 0.380 and 0.086% in the latter. In both breeds, (a) disomy was significantly more frequent than diploidy (P < 0.01), (b) YY disomy was significantly (P < 0.001) more frequent than XY or XX; (c) MI errors (XY disomy) were significantly (P < 0.01) less represented than MII (XX + YY disomy). Compared to the dairy (Italian Friesian and Brown) and meat (Podolian and Maremmana) breeds previously analyzed, the \"minor\" breeds investigated in the present study showed a significantly (P < 0.002) higher rate of X-Y aneuploidy (0.486 vs. 0.159 and 0.190%, respectively). Considering all the breeds analyzed -so far- and assuming no significant interchromosomal effect, the baseline level of aneuploidy in the sperm population of the species Bos taurus was estimated as 5.19%. Establishing the baseline level of aneuploidy in the sperm population of the various livestock species/breeds engaged in animal production could reveal useful for monitoring future trends of their reproductive health, especially in relation to management errors and/or environmental hazards." ;

The Mammotome® 11G (S1) or EnCor® 10G (S2) probes were used randomly. Sampling time and the number of frustules collected were considered; sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of both procedures were evaluated, considering the final histological examination as reference (B1, B3, B5 lesions underwent surgical excision; B2 lesion were considered confirmed after a negative follow-up of at least 1 year).\nRESULTS:\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients according to the number of procedures (S1 82/169; S2 87/169), average age, BIRADS category (4a, b), and average size of the lesions. The two systems did not differ statistically for correlation with the final histology (S1 k = 0.94 ± 0.06; S2 k = 0.92 ± 0.08) and underestimation of B3 lesions or in situ (S1 4.5 %; S2 4.3 %). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, diagnostic accuracy of S1 and S2 were also not statistically different. The systems differed only in sampling time (S1 80; S2 63 s), but not in total procedure time.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nOur study confirms the effectiveness of VABB in the assessment of microcalcifications and highlights the lack of significant differences between the two systems in terms of diagnostic performance." ;

In 2005, they were described also as boosters of hyphal branching in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and thereby as promoters of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. In 2008, they emerged as a new class of plant hormones controlling plant architecture through repression of shoot branching. Since then, several new roles were discovered for SLs: in the adaptive responses to a number of environmental stimuli (including light, osmotic stress, interaction with pathogens and nodulating bacteria), and in several aspects of plant development (including seed germination for nonparasitic plants, hypocotyl elongation, reproduction, leaf senescence and nodulation). The biosynthetic and perception/transduction systems of SLs are being elucidated, and the first mechanistic models presented." ;

ApoB and ApoA1 measured in children and adolescents reflect a lipoprotein profile predisposing to the development of atherosclerosis in adulthood. Aim of the study is to check the relationship between carotid IMT (cIMT) and aortic IMT (aIMT) and biochemical risk markers of atherosclerosis in childhood. Methods: a healthy and dyslipidemic cohort comprising 255 children and adolescents (age 1-18 ys) underwent B-mode ultrasound.  In the group of dyslipidemic children 74 resulted affected by FH, 59 by FCHL, 32 by Hyperlipoprotein(a), 29 by dominant Hypercholesterolemia, 4 by FHTG and 1 by sitosterolemia. Finally 13 patients were obese or overweight. cIMT and aIMT were assessed by using B-mode ultrasound at 2 cm near the bulb and above the iliac bifurcation respectively and mean values were considered. Lipid profile was evaluated by standard methods. Statistical analysis were performed by SPSS15.0 software. Results: In all subjects IMT measurement increased with age independently from gender. In the whole cohort, cIMT positively correlated with LDL-C (rho=0.13, p=0.040) and non-HDL-C (rho=0.15, p=0.002), while a negative correlation was found with HDL-C (rho= -0.19, p=0.003) and ApoA1 (rho= -0.18, p=0.005). Furthermore both aIMT and cIMT resulted significantly related to Apo B levels (rho= 0.16, p=0.027; rho= 0.18, p=0.006). Conclusion: The present study detected, for the first time in children, a correlation between cIMT and non-HDL-C and ApoB as well as aIMT and ApoB. Recent guidelines have emphasized the importance of non-HDL-C as predictor of cardiovascular risk and ApoB as relevant proatherogenic marker, even stronger than LDL-C. Therefore these results support the usefulness of ApoB and non-HDL-C values, as well as cIMT and aIMT measurements, in pediatric lipid risk assessment." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "The efficient separation of pig slurry into its solid and liquid components is useful on a farm where the removal of excess nutrients is desired. This study investigates the effec- tiveness of two pre-treatments (chitosan, and biochar) in separating pig slurry using two methods of mechanical separation (screw press SP and centrifugation CENT). Several indicatorsdhigh dry matter and phosphorus in solids, and low P, Cu, and Zn content in liquidsdinformed the evaluation. Overall, results showed that chitosan addition changed the elemental content in both fractions of the SP group, but not in liquid fractions of the CENT group. Chitosan produced loosened flocs sensitive to SP pressure, but more resistant to centrifugation. Added biochar increased mass efficiency by 2e3% in both separation methods, but had little effect on the chemicals tested, except for the elemental content of solids produced in the SP group. The combination of chitosan and biochar performed worse than when treated with chitosan alone. Based on simple and reduced separation indices, no treatments affected the separation efficiency of the mechanical separators. Despite pre- treatment failures, there is some indication that under different experimental conditions, these pre-treatments may be beneficial when separating manure." ;

One hundred and fifteen patients underwent chest x-rays and AMBER for the diagnosis of silicosis. Five readers blindly and independently evaluated the radiograms with standard ILO/UC classification scales. Reproducibility was assessed using ANOVA repeated measurements methods. AMBER showed a better technical quality of radiograms than conventional chest x-rays; interobserver reproducibility was high and similar (R = 0.75); intraobserver agreement between chest x-rays and AMBER was high ranging from 0.62 to 0.86 for the 5 readers. Notwithstanding the absence of standards for profusion classification, the interobserver reproducibility with AMBER was similar to that obtained with chest x-rays. Moreover, the intraobserver agreement in profusion scoring between AMBER and chest radiography was high, suggesting that AMBER and chest radiography provided similar information in the evaluation of silicosis." ;

In events of the case in point, the risk of the explosion of combustibile materials, which make up the weaponry of the vehicle and the equipment of the individual military personnel involved, which have not detonated despite the fire and are therefore still present at the scene of the disaster, overlaps the usual operative difficulties linked to sizeable alterations in the cadavers (carbonisation, mutilations, etc.) or places. Clearing the area to be inspected of both the burned out vehicle and the remians of cadavers to examined appears to be an indispenaable, prelimnary operation. To complete inspection operations,  also meant to recover any items useful in identifying the victims, investigation must proceed by means of a qualified team of experts in the specific sector (forensic pathologists, dentists, radiologists, anthropologists, hematologists, finger-footprint specialists, forensic photographers) in a cenrre provided with equipment for performing the necessary assessments and verifications (Xray machines, post mortem tables, refrigeration compartments, etc.) in order to obtain the most acurate representation of the total injuries of each victim. Thi also contributes to reconstructing the dynamics and the nature of the event. For military personnel from foreign contingents, a special workstation must also be provided which is alocated to procedures for embalming the remains, assuming that the coffins of the victims will be exposed to a military honours ceremony. To exemplify the complexity of the investigation and problems pertaining to this type of event, the AA describe the procedures employed at Dover Air Force Base (Dealware, USA) during the examination of the remains of 19 marines who died in Marana (Arizona) in April 2000, following the precipitation and consequent explosion of a military helicopter (MV22 Osprey) which occurred during an exercise." ;

However, its use is limited because of its high degradability and weak solubility. Indeed, the structure of camptothecin presents a lactone ring that is subjected to hydrolysis in physiological conditions with consequent inactivation of the topoisomerase binding activity. In the present study a new formulation of CPT embedded in cyclodextrin-based nanosponges (CN-CPT) [3] has been evaluated in vitro on prostate cancer models. CN-CPT manifested a strong antitumoral efficacy revealed by MTT and colony forming assay on hormonal independent PC3 and DU145 cells, significantly higher as compared to the same dose of free CPT. Moreover, cell cycle analysis and annexin V/PI staining showed that CN-CPT treatments induced significant apoptotic cell death at 1 nM (61.7% apoptotic cell death; p<<0.001), where free CTP (4.36% apoptotic cell death) was not effective. In order to evaluate the induction of DNA damage, the phosphorylation status of histone H2A.X (p-H2A.X) has been evaluated. Results indicated that DNA damage was caused by CN-CPT only in both DU145 and PC-3 cells. To evaluate possible antimetastatic activity of CPT, in vitro experiments of tumor cell adhesion to HUVECs as a model of endothelium and cell motility were performed. Results showed that CN-CPT was effective at lower doses compared to CPT in inducing inhibition of adhesion and motility. In order to evaluate whether androgen receptor signaling could affect the responsiveness to either CPT or CN-CPT the AR expressing murine models (MYC-AD, PTEN8 and PTEN CAP8) and human model (LNCaP) of prostate cancer have been used. Results showed that expression of functional AR diminished the efficacy of both CPT and CN-CPT. However the latter still exerted greater effects compared to CN-CPT. Taken together these results support the use of CPT and the development of nanotechnologies for drug delivery in the treatment of castrate refractory prostate cancer." ;

Preliminary studies have detected increased plasma levels of MMP8 and MMP9 in patients with acute aortic dissection (AAD). However, the performance of plasma MMP8 and MMP9 for the diagnosis of AAD in the emergency department is at present unknown.\nMETHODS:\nThe levels of MMP8 and MMP9 were measured by ELISA on plasma samples obtained from 126 consecutive patients evaluated in the emergency department for suspected AAD. All patients were subjected to urgent computed tomography (CT) scan for final diagnosis.\nRESULTS:\nIn the study cohort (N = 126), AAD was diagnosed in 52 patients and ruled out in 74 patients. Median plasma MMP8 levels were 36.4 (interquartile range 24.8 to 69.3) ng/ml in patients with AAD and 13.2 (8.1 to 31.8) ng/ml in patients receiving an alternative final diagnosis (P <0.0001). Median plasma MMP9 levels were 169.2 (93.0 to 261.8) ng/ml in patients with AAD and 80.5 (41.8 to 140.6) ng/ml in patients receiving an alternative final diagnosis (P = 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) on receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of MMP8 and MMP9 for the diagnosis of AAD was respectively 0.75 and 0.70, as compared to 0.87 of D-dimer. At the cutoff of 3.6 ng/ml, plasma MMP8 had a sensitivity of 100.0% (95% CI, 93.2% to 100.0%) and a specificity of 9.5% (95% CI, 3.9% to 18.5%) and ruled out AAD in 5.6% of patients. Combination of plasma MMP8 with D-dimer increased the AUC on ROC analysis to 0.89. Presence of MMP8 <11.0 ng/ml and D-dimer <1.0 or <2.0 µg/ml provided a negative predictive value of 100% and ruled out AAD in 13.6% and 21.4% of patients respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nLow levels of plasma MMP8 can rule out AAD in a minority of patients. Combination of plasma MMP8 and D-dimer at individually suboptimal cutoffs could safely rule out AAD in a substantial proportion of patients evaluated in the emergency department." ;

Cyber war is no longer based on physical violence only, but on military, political, economic and ideological strategies meant to exploit a state’s informational resources. This means that a deeper understanding of what cyber war is requires us to adopt an informational approach. This approach may enable us to account for the two-dimensional nature of cyber war (destruction and exploitation), to revise the notion of violence on which war is premised and to understand to what extent the traditional ideas of ‘just war’ may apply to the scenario of cyber warfare. This point is crucial, since it concerns whether a cyber war is meant to restore a broken international political and legal order or to participate in its construction." ;

The series consisted of 149 patients examined in 8 different centers and submitted to ultrasonography (US), Computed Tomography (CT) before and after contrast agent administration, angiography and Lipiodol CT. According to lesion size and number, the patients were divided with each imaging modality into three groups: a) group 1: unifocal HCC < 5 cm diameter; b) group 2: multifocal HCC with 2-3 nodules and/or tumor mass < 80 ml; c) multifocal HCC with more than 3 nodules (with total tumor mass not exceeding 40% of liver volume) or with total tumor mass > 80 ml. In 77 patients all the examinations were available for comparison. US and CT diagnosed more patients as belonging to group 1 than angiography and Lipiodol CT, while more patients were classified as groups 2 and 3 with angiography and Lipiodol CT, meaning that US and CT may understage some HCC cases (about 15%) because they show a lower number of nodules. This observation was confirmed by the direct comparison between US and Lipiodol CT (in 114 patients), CT and Lipiodol CT (in 103 patients) and angiography and Lipiodol CT (in 116 patients). US and Lipiodol CT were in disagreement in 18 cases, CT and Lipiodol CT in 16 cases and angiography and Lipiodol CT in 13 cases. In most of these cases, Lipiodol CT showed more lesions than the other techniques. The size of the undetected lesions was small, ranging few mm to 2 cm in nearly all cases. To conclude, the results of this multicentric trial show that Lipiodol CT is a fundamental tool to evaluate HCC extent. In contrast, conventional CT appeared not to add any significant piece of information and can therefore be excluded from the diagnostic protocol of HCC." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "After attending this presentation, attendees will understand thepotential contributions of postmortem investigation of nasal mucociliarymotility in time of death estimation.This presentation will impact the forensic science community byemphasizing the potential role of nasal scraping that could become aroutine procedure in estimating time-since-death.Postmortem interval (PMI) estimation is one of the most difficultissues in forensic medicine. Time-of-death is usually appreciated byrecognizing early postmortem changes to the body prior to the onset ofgross decomposition phenomena: algor mortis, rigor mortis, and livormortis.The study of these physical processes is strictly connected to theoperator’s subjectivity hence it can be source of confusion in estimatingPMI. Moreover these body changes can be altered by several internaland external factors: body temperature at death time, subcutaneous fat,muscular mass, clothes, environmental temperature, humidity, andventilation.There have been many proposed innovative methods in attempts toavoid this trouble defining PMI objectively as possible. The goal ofthese new techniques is to find a link between PMI and objectivelydetectable values such as infrared tympanic thermography, skinfluorescence, electrolyte concentration in cerebro-spinal fluid,pericardial fluid or vitreous humor. All these samples, on the other hand,present practical difficulties in performing and require invasive methodsand long time waiting.Some studies have been published about nasal scraping role inclinical practice (ciliary dyskinesia, NARES, allergic rhinosinusitis), butno studies have never been performed in cadavers for PMI estimation.A study concerning the examination of ciliary motility as residuallife phenomenon, realizing a study on time of death evaluation using anew, rapidly available requiring substrate: nasal mucosa is presented.Nasal mucosa is composed by numerous cell types (globet cells,basal cells, ciliated and not ciliated cells) and can be easily obtained bynasal scraping, a technique commonly used in otolaryngology; it consistsof a curette crept on nasal mucosa and cells picked up in this way arethen observed.From June 2009 to June 2010, nasal scraping in 70 cadavers wasperformed. Age ranged from 24 to 95 years and the cause of death wasmost frequently due from ischemic cardiopathy, septic shock, and caraccident. The only exclusion criteria of this study was nose bleeding.A specimen of ciliated epithelium was obtained by scraping fromthe middle third of the inferior turbinate with a spoon-shaped nasal probe(Rhinoprobe). An in vitro evaluation of ciliary movement wasperformed. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was analyzed by phasecontrastmicroscopy. Three different samples at different postmortemintervals were carried out: between 4 and 6 h (T1), between 10 and 12 h(T2) and after 24 h (T3). Then CBF (beat number/second) was classifiedin: present (3-4/sec), hypo-valid (1-2/sec) and absent.Results demonstrated that, except for those cases which showedfungal or bacterial infections, at T1 motility was present in the majorityof cases; at T2 motility was still present, but it was hypo-valid in a higherpercentage. Ciliary activity was absent at T3. It is believed that all thesefindings can be explained with progressive metabolic reserves lowering:the more time passes after death, the more ciliated cells loose energeticsubstrates for ciliary motility.In conclusion, mucociliary motility seems to be linked to PMI andthus nasal scraping can be considered as a new, easy, cheap, and efficientobjective tool in detecting PMI; further studies are required." ;

An escape favored by the consolidation of a loser image of rural territories in strong contrast with urban areas. In the last ten years an interesting turnaround has been verified, putting into effect a conscious movement of return to rural-mountainous areas. The protagonists of this return are people that comes from other territories and valorizes local resources in an innovative way: a new style to live rural areas (physical -demographic, cultural and social return). In this territorial dynamics, the land-resource represents one of the most important element to put in value: the agricultural activity increases ,especially in Piedmont Region, combining tradition and innovativeness. This return to the land has an ecological and territorial implications both in terms of protection and safeguard of biodiversity and maintenance of territory both in terms of renewability of the land-resource and low level of ecological impact." ;

Closure of such small wounds can be difficult and many techniques and devices have been developed for port sites closure.\nThe aim of this study is to describe a new method for trocar site closure in pigs and to compare it with a previously described technique.\nMaterials and methods\nThe new technique uses the trocar sheath to guard a curved needle passed transcutaneously with the abdomen inflated. The suture is then retrieved subcutaneously and tied.\nThe feasibility and effectiveness of the new proposed technique was evaluated and compared with a previously described technique that uses the trocar sheath and retractors to pass a ski-needle in the fascia. Both techniques were evaluated on small(9 kg) and larger dead pigs(40 kg) for the ability in closing abdominal layers.\nHealing of 5 mm and 10 mm trocar site wounds closed with both techniques was then compared in 8 live animals(40 kg).\nResults\nBoth techniques allowed closure of all layers in small pigs but only the new proposed technique allowed closure of all layers in animals with a thicker abdominal wall. In live animals healing of trocar wounds was complete at 8 days postoperatively, unregarding of trocar size or technique used.\nDiscussion\nBoth techniques can be performed without specific instruments and are fast and inexpensive.

In recent years the forewings of worker bees sampled in A. m. mellifera, A. m. ligustica, A. m. carnica, and hybrid colonies were examined and various abnormalities - due to the presence of both supernumerary and defective veins - were observed. The supernumerary veins were considered as present only if an evident vein length could be detected, while slight thickenings were ignored. Most colonies did not show any teratology in wing venation, while a few ones provided several workers with abnormal wings; in these cases, some individuals showed two or more abnormalities. Spurs of various length protruding from the standard veins were the most frequent abnormalities observed; among them an adventitious distal abscissa of the 2rs-m crossvein, a spur protruding from the 2nd abscissa of Rs vein into the 1st submarginal cell, and the extension of the Rs vein beyond the distal end of the marginal\ncell were rather common. In some cases two opposed spurs tended to join or a single vein branched, thus defining an open or even closed supernumerary cell. In defective veins the missing stretch varied considerably in length so that in a few cases two contiguous cells merged more or less completely. Wing venation teratology should be taken into account when using the wing venation pattern for a morphometric distinction of honey bee subspecies, and data from abnormal wings should not be acquired, especially if automated procedures are used." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Because of the high bargaining power of large retailers, their suppliers face a strong pressure to be very \ncompetitive in both price and quality as well as being responsive to customer demands. This pressure is \nresulting in food supply chains becoming leaner and leaner from the perspective of value added delivery and \ncost efficiency. Consequently, the application of some paradigms such as Lean Thinking, Total Quality \nManagement, and Supply Chain Management are now playing a significant role in agro-food supply-chains. \nLean thinking or lean production, often simply, \"Lean\" is a management paradigm that considers the \nexpenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, \nand thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or \nservice, \"value\" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Basically, \nlean is centered on enhancing value while consuming less resources.   \nThe paper reports on the development of a district-based brand certifying the zero CO2e footprint of local \nsupply chain for onions and potatoes, that deals with the use of lean approach for a  rationalization of the \nlocal supply chain for the two crops, resulting in significant reduction of energy and water consumption in the \ncultivation of onions and potatoes in the Province of Alessandria, in the Southern part of the Piedmont \nRegion in Italy, and increase in both sustainability and economic performance of the supply chain.  Currently, \nboth crops have high production costs, in particular to the cost of inefficient irrigation practices, limited \nstorage structures with high energy consumption mostly due to poor refrigeration. \nThe objective of the paper is to present a strategy to improve the competitiveness of both crops by promoting \na eco-sustainability certification process, as well as ensuring water and electricity savings and the \ndevelopment and use of renewable energy sources, primarily biofuels produced from locally grown crops and \nlocally created biomass, through the application of lean principles to the enhancement of the supply-chain. \nThe ZEROEMISSION model has been developed to promote this process.  \nThe BAT (Best Available Techniques) that are implemented by ZEROEMISSION model include:Innovative \nwater-based refrigeration technologies, utilization of this water for high efficiency irrigation techniques for the \ntwo crops, optimization of logistics in the transport of the crops to the packing center, biofuels powered water \npumps, biofuels powered equipment, production of biofuels from locally produced crops and biomass.  \nThe lean&green methodology was applied to optimize the use of energy and to increase the efficiency of the \nwater used for irrigation purposes. The tool used to analyze the “kaizen” – possible improvement points - \nwas the Value Stream Mapping tools. The tool allowed to track down the flow of the interested resource (e.g. \nwater, energy, emissions) inside the analysed process. \nOne important improvement was the adoption of Innovative water-based refrigeration technologies, and the \nuse of the water effuent from the refrigeration unit for high efficiency irrigation techniques for onions and \npotatoes. The savings of water and energy were analysed related to a conditioning facility that can store \nabout 3000 t of produce. The results, considering a production of 2050 t of potatoes and 700 t of onions, \nallowed savings of 130 t/year  of CO2 and 32407 m3/year of water." ;

No studies on rose have ever documented simultaneous change in ABA and IAA during these developmental phases in both seed coat and embryo. Plant growth regulators were extracted and then quantified by using high performance liquid chromatography based on solid phase extraction purification. In both the seed coat and embryo, ABA content decreased from 28 DAP (4.39 and 1.36 pmol mg-1,\nrespectively) and onward. Endogenous IAA in seed coat\nfollowed the same trend.

Thereby, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the potential of different mechanical and acoustic properties to assess the perceived firmness and crunchiness of table grape cultivars.\nMethods and Results: The ripening effect was minimized by densimetric sorting of the berries before testing. The textural quality of seven table grape cultivars was evaluated by sensory analysis. Furthermore, three mechanical tests (texture profile analysis, cutting, and denture) were performed on the berry flesh or whole berries, and the acoustic emission produced was recorded simultaneously. Correlation studies showed strong and significant relationships between sensory texture attributes and instrumental parameters, particularly for the denture test. Nevertheless, satisfactory predictive accuracy for the perceived crunchiness required multivariate linear regression involving both mechanical and acoustic properties resulting from the denture test performed on whole berries. In this case, residual predictive interquartile amplitude (RPIQ) was higher than 2. Most of the reliable models developed for the perceived firmness are fairly recommended not for quantitative purposes but for fast screening (1.6<RPIQ<2).\nSignificance of the Study: A combined mechanic-acoustic strategy was not previously used in table grapes and represents a powerful tool for a more complete and exhaustive texture characterization, particularly firmness and crunchiness, by means of a more objective and standardized protocol." ;

For this reason we affirm that educational robotics makes possible to integrate programming activities in current schools curricula rather than adding some form of ICT as one more subject side of traditional subjects. Such integration is important because rarely addressed in other approaches for introducing technology in education though considered as the best use  of computing in schools already in Papert’s researches of the 1970ies. Here we describe in progress activities with 12 to 14 years old pupils using the RCX and NXT Lego bricks and writing programs in a Logo-like programming language with a development environment specifically implemented for young students. A promising direction of work is exploiting how robot programming can support teachers in motivating elementary algebra, typically addressed in secondary junior schools, with opportunities of relating particular solutions to more general ones." ;

In this paper we devise ENIGMA, an architecture for the back-end of BLCS systems able to provide adequate levels of access and transfer performance, availability, integrity, and confidentiality, for the data it stores. ENIGMA exploits LT rateless codes to store fragments of sectors on storage nodes organized in clusters. We quantitatively evaluate how the various ENIGMA system parameters affect the performance, availability, integrity, and confidentiality of virtual disks. These evaluations are carried out by using both analytical modeling (for availability, integrity, and confidentiality) and discrete event simulation (for performance), and by considering a set of realistic operational scenarios. Our results indicate that it is possible to simultaneously achieve all the objectives set forth for BLCS systems by using ENIGMA, and that a careful choice of the various system parameters is crucial to achieve a good compromise among them. Moreover, they also show that LT coding-based BLCS systems outperform traditional BLCS systems in all the aspects mentioned before." ;

The authors report their personal experience with 137 percutaneous gastrostomies performed on 98 men and 39 women from January 1986 through December 1993. All the maneuvers were performed under fluoroscopic guidance in the patients with head or neck cancer, neoplastic, vascular or post-traumatic neuropathy and upper GI tract cancer. To avoid left hepatic lobe trauma, percutaneous gastrostomy needs to be performed under US guidance. A 7F nasogastric tube is used to fill the stomach with air. After distending the gastric cavity, with the Seldinger technique under local anesthesia, fascial dilators of progressively increasing caliber are introduced into the gastric cavity and the final 12F gastrostomy catheter is positioned under fluoroscopic guidance. No major complications, such as hemorrhage or peritonitis, occurred. In one case, during the maneuver, the patient complained of severe epigastric pain which regressed with no further problems two hours later. In three cases the gastrostomy catheter fell out of place and was replaced by running the fistolous tract with a venous cannula and then a guidewire for gastrostomy repositioning. With this type of treatment, the patient can be given enteral feeding the following day. The maneuver requires approximately 10 minutes to perform and is well tolerated by the patient as it requires no general anesthesia. Percutaneous gastrostomy is more cost-effective than surgery or endoscopy and hospitalization is shorter. The only contraindications to this maneuver are hepatomegaly (because of the risk of liver trauma during percutaneous maneuvers), ascites (because of the risk of infection) and finally the complications resulting from gastric resection." ;

The literature lacking a systematic treatise on the radiologic features of this disease, the authors decided to collect the case histories of 9 patients, 5 men and 4 women, 24 to 48 years old, suffering from osteosarcoma of the jaw. Both conventional radiography and CT were used to examine all patients. The accurate study of radiologic findings made it possible to establish 3 basic lesion patterns. The first and very rare one, is characterized by the total absence of neoplastic tissue ossification processes; in this case, the radiologic diagnosis is extremely difficult, even with CT support. The second and more common pattern exhibits evident tumor neo-ossification, the most representative cases present several bone lamellae radiating from the lesion, with a sunburst-like appearance. The disease can be diagnosed with conventional radiography alone, especially in the most advanced cases; CT permits the identification of early forms, missed with conventional methods. The third pattern is characterized by amorphous lesion ossification: there are small areas of structureless ossification and a patchy appearance, separated by non-ossified neoplastic tissue. CT shows tumor ossification missed at conventional radiography. Finally, the authors observed an extremely rare case of parosteal sarcoma of the jaw, considered a variety of osteosarcoma by some pathologists. The lesion presented uniform neo-ossification which was highly sclerotic and separated from cortical bone by a thin layer of radiolucent tissue: both findings were clearly visible with CT. In conclusion, the systemic use of CT has led to a marked improvement in the radiologic diagnosis of osteosarcoma of the jaw." ;

The project consists of two parts. A simple one and a less simple one. Both have the great advantage of being totally independent of the knowledge of the distance, ≃ 732 km, between the two Labs, CERN and LNGS, where the neutrinos are produced and detected, respectively. The \"simple\" version of this project is based on the high-energy horizontal cosmic muons, which traverse LVD and OPERA detectors, thus allowing to cross-calibrate the timing systems of both experiments in a way which is totally independent of the TOF measurements of CNGS. This component of the project is being studied in collaboration with the OPERA group, as the time stabilities of both experiments are needed. In fact it is since a long time that the two groups are engaged with this problem.

The\nERK5 gene may be amplified in hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC), but its biological role has not been clarified. In this\nstudy, we explored the role of ERK5 expression and\nactivity in HCC in vitro and in vivo.\nDesign. ERK5 expression was evaluated in human liver\ntissue. Cultured HepG2 and Huh-7 were studied after\nERK5 knockdown by siRNA or in the presence of the\nspecific pharmacological inhibitor, XMD8-92. The role of\nERK5 in vivo was assessed using mouse Huh-7\nxenografts.\nResults. In tissue specimens from patients with HCC, a\nhigher percentage of cells with nuclear ERK5 expression\nwas found both in HCC and in the surrounding cirrhotic\ntissue compared with normal liver tissue. Inhibition of\nERK5 decreased HCC cell proliferation and increased the\nproportion of cells in G0/G1 phase. These effects were\nassociated with increased expression of p27 and p15 and\ndecreased CCND1. Treatment with XMD8-92 or ERK5\nsilencing prevented cell migration induced by epidermal\ngrowth factor or hypoxia and caused cytoskeletal\nremodelling. In mouse xenografts, the rate of tumour\nappearance and the size of tumours were significantly\nlower when Huh-7 was silenced for ERK5. Moreover,\nsystemic treatment with XMD8-92 of mice with\nestablished HCC xenografts markedly reduced tumour\ngrowth and decreased the expression of the protooncogene\nc-Rel.\nConclusions. ERK5 regulates the biology of HCC cells\nand modulates tumour development and growth in vivo.\nThis pathway should be investigated as a possible\ntherapeutic target in HCC." ;

Based on the microhistological examination, the patients were divided into three groups [RS without hyperplasic-proliferative lesions (HPL); RS with HPL; RS with cancer] and we assessed the risk of cancer associated with RS in the first and second group. We evaluated the mammographic features and the BI-RADS categories assigned to RSs, the biopsy devices used and the differences between the pathological examination and the microhistological diagnosis (p < 0.05).\nRESULTS:\n\nBased on the microhistological examination, 51/80 patients were included in the first group (9 of them not subjected to surgery), 25/80 in the second group and 4/80 in the third one. At the final histological examination, there were 7/42 (16.7 %) cancers in the first group and 8/25 (32 %) in the second group. The largest number of microhistological underestimation occurred in the patients who were subjected to core biopsy (15 cases) (p < 0.05).

Until now, about 17 alleles associated to at least four levels of as1-casein expression in milk have been described at the CSN1S1 locus in the domestic goat (Capra hircus). The great importance of goat as1-casein polymorphism is due to its qualitative as well as quantitative implications. In the present work five PCR protocols (PCR-RFLPs, AS-PCR) were set up for rapid genotyping of B1, B2*, B3, B4 and C CSN1S1 alleles, until nowdetectable only by milk electrophoresis. Application of these protocols, together with previously described methods to identify CSN1S1 01, E, M, F, N and A* (CSN1S1 A, G, I, H) alleles, allow us to define, at DNA level, the genetic structure of the autochthonous goat reared in the province of Naples for the highest number of possible alleles at this locus.

The ratio between maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of DTC and SUVmean of the liver (SUV ratio) was recorded for each scan. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy and (131)I remnant ablation. After a median follow-up of 39 months we assessed the outcome. The association between disease persistence/progression, (18)F-FDG uptake and other risk factors (T, N, M and histological subtype) was evaluated through univariate and multivariate analyses.\nRESULTS:\nOf the 54 patients, 39 achieved complete remission. The remaining 15 showed persistence/progression of disease. High (18)F-FDG uptake, i.e. SUV ratio ≥3, showed a low positive predictive value (48 %). Low (18)F-FDG uptake (SUV ratio < 3) displayed a high negative predictive value (93 %). The median of SUV ratios in T1-T2 (2.2), in M0 (2.7) and in non-virulent subtypes (2.7) were significantly lower (p < 0.03) than in T3-T4 (5.0), M1 (7.3) and virulent subtypes (6.0). Kaplan-Maier analysis showed a significant association between high (18)F-FDG uptake and disease persistence/progression (p = 0.001). When we adjusted risk estimates by using a multivariate Cox model, only T (p = 0.05) remained independently associated with disease persistence/progression.\nCONCLUSION:\nAn intense (18)F-FDG uptake of the primary DTC is associated with persistence/progression of disease. However, when all other prognostic factors have been taken into account, (18)F-FDG uptake does not add further prognostic information." ;

After IVM (24 hours), COCs were transferred into 25/well with 300 μl IVF-TALP and covered with mineral oil. Frozen sperm from a bull were selected by centrifugation on a Percoll discontinuous gradient (45-80%). The pellet was diluted in IVF medium and added to the COCs at the concentration of 1 x 106 sperm/mL. Gametes were co-incubated for 20-22 h at 39°C, in 5% CO2 in air. After co-incubation, presumptive zygotes were vortexed to remove cumulus cells and randomly allocated in six groups, each into 400 μl of SOF medium, with 30 μl/ml essential amino acids, 10 μl/ml non-essential amino acids, 0.34 mM tri-sodium citrate, 2.77 mM myo-inositol, and 5% BS. Zygotes were incubated in a humidified mixture of 5% CO2, 7% O2 and 88% N2 in air at 39°C for 20-22 hours. Starting on Day 0 ( IVF day), embryos were taken out of the incubator at day 2(48 h),3 (72h),4 (96h), 5(120h), 6(144h) and 7(168h), examined under a stereomicroscope, treated in a lysing buffer (0.01 N HCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 30 sec, transferred in a small droplet to a precleaned slide and fixed with methanol-acetic acid (3:1). Out of 178 embryos (3,100 cells) analyzed, the mitotic index was 19.6 % (28/143 cells) at day 2, 18.6 % (41/221 cells) at day 3, 10.3 % (27/263 cells) at day 4, 7.1 % (26/367 cells) at day 5, 0.7 % (5/681 cells) at day 6 and 0.6 (9/1425 cells) at day 7.

Yet, to what extent is this a joint vision of all parties\ninvolved in the participatory video process? Why do researchers and participants do participatory video?\nWhat are their differential motivations and how does this affect decision-making during the participatory\nvideo process? In this paper, we reflect on these questions through discussing participatory video\nexperiences of research carried out by the authors in collaboration with indigenous communities in the\nNorth Rupununi, Guyana and in Tumucumaque, Brazil. Participatory video formed part of a project\ninvolving local communities, local, national and international civil society organisations and academic\nresearchers.We evaluate the different perceptions and distinct worldviews of the individuals, groups and\norganisations involved in the participatory video process, and show how these determine the ways in\nwhich people participate. We conclude that a significant component of the participatory video process\nneeds to include the iterative surfacing of individual motivations and worldviews using an adaptive\nresearch approach. This helps to negotiate expectations of all researchers and participants at different\nstages of the participatory video, enabling greater outcomes for all participants, while at the same time\nproducing more nuanced and grounded academic research." ;

One hundred and twelve subjects (85 women; 83.0 years on average; SD = 7.5) were included in the study, and divided into a MCE-group (MCE-G) and a control group (CG) according to matching techniques. The MCE-G consisted of a 9-month program featuring range-of-motion, strength, and balance exercises performed in small groups. The CG received routine medical and nursing care. The timed up-and-go test and Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment balance subscale were administered at baseline and postintervention. After controlling for physical baseline value, age, sex, residential care facilities, and body mass index, the MCE-G showed positive effects both on mobility (p < .001) and balance (p = .001). The role of balance as mediator in the relationship between participation to the MCE program and mobility was demonstrated." ;

For effective acoustic censuses, calibration methods must be determined by joint visual and acoustic studies. Research is still needed in the field of acoustic species identification, particularly for smaller odontocetes. From 1994 to 2012, whistles of four odontocete species were recorded in different areas of the Mediterranean Sea to determine how reliably these vocalizations can be classified to species. Recordings were attributed to species by simultaneous visual observation. The results of this study highlight that the frequency parameters, which are linked to physical features of animals, show lower variability than modulation parameters, which are likely to be more dependent on complex eco-ethological contexts. For all the studied species, minimum and maximum frequencies were linearly correlated with body size. DFA and Classification Tree Analysis (CART) show that these parameters were the most important for classifying species; however, both statistical methods highlighted the need for combining them with the number of contour minima and contour maxima for correct classification. Generally, DFA and CART results reflected both phylogenetic distance (especially for common and striped dolphins) and the size of the species." ;

Theory and Methods: The transverse relaxation rate of lanthanide-loaded liposomes receives contribution from the exchange between intraliposomal and bulk water protons, and from magnetic susceptibility effects. Phospholipids vesicles encapsulating different Ln(III)-HPDO3A complexes (Ln=Eu, Gd, or Dy) were prepared using the conventional thin film rehydration method. Relaxation times (T1, T2, and T2 *) were measured at 14 Tesla (T) and 25°C. The effect of compartmentalization of the paramagnetic agent inside the liposomal cavity was evaluated by means of an IRON-modified MRI sequence. Results: NMR measurements demonstrated that Curie spin relaxation is the dominant contribution (> 90%) to the observed transverse relaxation rate of paramagnetic liposomes. This was further confirmed by MRI that showed the ability of the liposome entrapped lanthanide complexes to generate IRON-MRI positive contrast in a size dependent manner. Conclusion: The Curie spin relaxation mechanism is by far the principal mechanism involved in the T2 shortening of the water protons in suspension of paramagnetic liposomes at 14T. The access to IRON contrast extends the potential of such nanosystems as MRI contrast agents." ;

The aims of this study are to evaluate the performance of several phenological models for predicting the pollen start of season (PSS) in 7 spring-flowering trees (Alnus glutinosa, Acer negundo, Carpinus betulus, Platanus occidentalis, Juglans nigra, Alnus viridis and Castanea sativa) and in two summer-flowering herbaceous species (Artemisia vulgaris and Ambrosia artemisiifolia) by using a 26-year aerobiological data set collected in Turin (Northern Italy). Data showed a reduced interannual variability of the PSS in the summer flowering species compared to the spring flowering ones. \nSpring Warming models with photoperiod limitation performed best for the greater majority of the studied species, while Chilling class models were selected only for the early spring flowering species. \nFor Ambrosia and Artemisia, Spring Warming models were also selected as the best models, indicating that temperature sums are positively related to flowering. However, the poor variance explained by the models suggests that further analyses have to be carried out in order to develop better models for predicting the PSS in these two species. \nModeling the pollen season start on a very wide data set provided a new opportunity to highlight the limits of models in elucidating the environmental factors driving the pollen season start when some factors are always fulfilled, as chilling or photoperiod or when the variance is very poor and is not explained by the models." ;

High levels of lactoferrin may have a role in the prevention of microbial infection of the mammary gland. In this report we sequenced and characterized goat lactoferrin cDNA and its promoter region in two different breeds of goat. The complete cDNA comprised 2356 nucleotides, including 38bp at the 5'-UTR and 194bp at the 3'-UTR. The open reading frame is 2127bp long and it encodes a mature protein of 689 aminoacids. A total of 19 nucleotide differences, 11 of them being responsible for 8 aminoacid changes, were identified through the comparison with French, Korean and Tibetan goat lactoferrin cDNAs. About 1700bp of the lactoferrin gene promoter were sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed a non-canonical TATA box, multiple SP1/GC elements, and other putative binding sites for transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB, STAT3 and AP2. Two SNPs were identified, one of which would seem to create a new putative AP2 consensus sequence. The presence of an additional AP2 binding site could be associated with quantitative differences of such protein fraction, which could enhance all the activities related to such protein, and improve mammary gland defence against bacterial infections." ;

EEIAs allow the coexistence of many companies that interact and adopt principles of the industrial ecology. The paper examines the way of managing an EEIA, with a particular focus on the check of the environmental aspects and the compliance with the environmental legal requirements. The necessity to define a management system of the area, as specific requirement of the EEIA, is satisfied by an environmental management system, in accordance with the European Regulation 1221/2009 EMAS - Eco-Management and Audit Scheme. It helps companies in the environmental management of processes and it envisages an “Environmental Declaration” that allows citizens to know the environmental profile of the company.\nFurthermore, considering that an EEIA occupies a portion of territory, it would be also possible to extend the environmental assessment to the landscape issue, by an Environmental and Landscape Management System (ELMS) that integrates the EMAS Regulation with the European Landscape Convention (ELC)." ;

Tipiche di quella fase sono state talune incertezze di metodo, come l’uso argomentativo del codice civile, benché non applicabile, o della traduzione italiana della Convenzione, testo non ufficiale. Viceversa la produzione successiva, seppur esigua, s’è rivelata pregevole. Sentenze rispettose del principio d’interpretazione autonoma – e perciò inclini all’osservanza dei precedenti stranieri così come al rifiuto dell’homeward trend – hanno affrontato temi spinosi anche per il diritto “domestico”: buona fede e divieto di \"venire contra factum\", formazione del contratto e \"battle of forms\" (o “battaglia dei formulari”), denuncia di non-conformità dei beni venduti sono solo alcuni dei profili ove la nostra giurisprudenza ha saputo recepire ed arricchire la giurisprudenza internazionale sulla Convenzione.

The landmark sports have been football, which, above all others, is linked to the use of the ball through our feet and rhythmic gymnastics implying, within the study of the body effort, the use of other parts of the body and, therefore, also the feet. The test has been submitted to Suism students of Turin attending the course of Skill Structuring.\nMethod: The two-month test has been developed in three main phases. If the first has been dedicated to the research of foot sensitization situations considered in the different segments, the second has examined the specific elements of the ball (knocking a ball about, rolling, throwing) both in individual situation and application to the group. Finally, the third phase has been aimed at organizing and classifying the skills according to the schemes and the parameters mentioned in the bibliography.\nResults:   About 40 specific motor skills have been pointed out by the students, distributed in a taxonomy including 10 items, referable to basic elements useful in an initial phase of introduction to sport.  Youth sport, strictly linked to the structuring of motor skills, is increasingly making use of transversal competences. Two main reasons: the path of introduction to sport should take into consideration the growth and the establishment of solid common bases (multilateralism) in order to enter and develop a motor speech aiming at one discipline." ;

Esta investigación también cuestiona el significado \"flexible\" de la ciudadanía y considera el rol de las memorias culturales y de los síntomas, pensados come formas de \"contra-memoria\" (Lipstiz) en un escenario dominado por la hegemonía cultural de la psiquiatría occidental y de sus categorías diagnósticas. En este sentido, la noció de \"competencia cultural\" ocupa un rol importante, per no suficiente en la deconstrucción de las categorías hegemónicas.

However, suchstudies have generally utilized conventional assessments of size and shapevariables, and as such fail to record the true nature of shape differences dueto dimorphism in this functional skeletal element. The research herepresented utilizes geometric morphometric techniques to investigate andquantify shape and size variation in the morphology of the mandibular corpusand ascending ramus, and consequently the potential for forensic humanidentification. The results of a novel morphometric study using clinicalpanoramic scanning x-radiography to study the extent of morphologicalvariation within a modern Italian sample population are presented.Clinical digital orthopantogram images (OPG) were acquired of theupper and lower jaws of 50 male and 50 female participants. Ten type I andtype II 2D landmarks were applied to the symphysis, and condylar andcoronoid processes. One hundred equidistant semi-landmarks wereestablished along the inferior border of the corpus, and the posterior borderof the ascending ramus. The resulting landmark configurations (n 100) weresubjected to Generaliszd Procrustes Analysis (GPA) with Full Tangent SpaceProjection. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied in order toassess population variation. Factor loadings were subject to CanonicalVariates Analysis with stepwise and leave-one-out classification in order toassess the effects of sexual dimorphism on mandibular shape. The resultsshowed individuals to be correctly classified for sex in 89.6% of cases,(males were correctly classified in 90.1% of cases, and females in 85.6%).Analyzes of the mandible were subsequently broken down intoanatomical regions based on the mandibular body, the bony processes andthe ascending ramus in order to investigate regional functional differencesin the expression of dimorphism in mandible. A partial least squares (2-block PLS) method was further applied, in order to examine patterns ofcovariation between shape variables and the exploration of patterns offunctional modularity. Most interestingly the results indicate the greatestlevel of individual and sex-specific variation is found in the shape-curveand pattern of the inferior corpus, in contrast to that of ramal flexure.Stepwise permutation tests and analyzes of regional covariation indicatefunctional coupling, with a moderate degree of modular integrationbetween the corporal and ramal regions suggesting that functional tiesbetween the units are correlated in influencing sex-based morphologicaltrait expression between anatomical regions, indicating that the geometricrelationship between the mandibular corpus and the ascending ramus offerssignificant power for forensic identification purposes. Consequently suchunits may be studied together or in isolation, and this may allow for thedevelopment of identification criteria based on modular unit shape variableswhich may be applicable for both whole specimens and fragmentedremains depending on the forensic situation. Overall the results are stronglysignificant and suggest that both dependently and independently that the406 * Presenting Authorshape relationship between the mandibular corpus and the ascending ramusoffers significant power for forensic identification purposes. Of particularinterest is that inferior corpus border shape offers significant discriminatingpotential in the assessment of sex, with the effects of allometry beingstrongly implicated.

In this paper we present an algorithm we refer to as the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD and use it to emphasize two important points which -- while not entirely new -- present a paradigm shift under way in the practical application of kernel-based approximation methods: (i) it is not necessary to form the kernel matrix (in fact, it might even be a bad idea to do so), and (ii) it is not necessary to know the kernel in closed form. While the Hilbert-Schmidt SVD and its two implications apply to general positive definite kernels, we introduce in this paper a class of so-called iterated Brownian bridge kernels which allow us to\nkeep the discussion as simple and accessible as possible." ;

Generally, adults are subject to immediate deportation ordetention in jail. Minors are processed through the juvenile system,where detection is not mandatory; they will often have access toeducational programs and may be granted a residency permit. Theassessment of chronological age is notoriously difficult. Age assessmentis particularly difficult for those who are aged between 15 and 20 years,yet it is precisely this age group where the assessment of age and theoutcome of the process is most critical.In this context dental age estimation methods have proved versatileand are used effectively in various European countries facing the problemof illegal immigration. The purpose of this presentation is to showdifferent examples of dental age estimation through case studies, whereodontologists played a major role in age assessment. A review of sixunaccompanied asylum seeker/refugees cases from Iceland, Italy andSerbia are presented.Case 1: Presents a case in Iceland which was requested byIcelandic Directorate of Immigrants. A male from Albaniainsisting to be 16-years-old, was found to be over 20.Case 2: Presents a case in Iceland which was requested byIcelandic Directorate of Immigrants where a female fromChina claiming to be 17. Estimates confirmed the probabilitythat the she was the age claimed, given the standard deviation.Kullman (1992), Mincer (1993) and Haavikko (1970) dentalage estimation methods were employed.Cases 3 & 4: Presents two cases in Italy which were requestedby Immigration Police authorities and Judges. A male fromNigeria and a male from Iraq, both claiming to be minors.Relying on skeletal maturation as seen on an x-ray of the wrist,iliac crests, and dental panoramic (Harris, 1984; Kullman, 1992and Moorrees, 1963), together with background informationand external examination of each individual, only case twoproved to be under 18.Cases 5 & 6: Presents two cases from Serbia requested bySerbian NGO “Praxis.” The cases examined regard tworefugees from Kosovo who escaped after NATO bombing in* Presenting Author 2631999. In both cases, tables by Kahl & Schwartz (1988) Mincer(1993), Olze (2003), Orhan (2007), Gunst (2003), and fromSmith (1991) were employed by an odontologist to verify thereal year of birth in order to issue proper identificationdocuments. The experts’ report was based on therecommendations of Forensic Age Estimation Study Group ofthe German Association for Forensic Medicine includinganthropometric measures and radiological analysis of the wrist.The age claimed was confirmed by the procedures.The presentation does not attempt to give a definitive account of thedifferent scientific methods for the assessment of age, but age estimationof unaccompanied minors is a fundamental principle of human rights anddignity. Apossible increase in the accuracy of age estimation process canonly be achieved by using multiple age estimation parameters. In orderto achieve and maximize the effectiveness of the age assessment process,implementation of international standards through a technical table withthe political will is needed.

Parallel and grid computing are solutions to the increasing need for computing power. High level languages offer a high degree of abstraction which ease the development of complex systems. Moreover, being based on formal semantics, it is possible to certify the correctness of critical parts of the applications.\nAlgorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages such as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming, parallel execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries, genericity and meta-programming in object-oriented languages, etc. have produced methods and tools that improve the price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of target applications.\nThe PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level programming languages, libraries, middlewares and tools (performance predictors working on high-level parallel/grid source code, visualisations of abstract behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors, high-level GRID resource managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.), applications in all fields of computational science, benchmarks and experiments. Research on high-level grid programming is particularly relevant as well as domain specific parallel software.\nThe aim of all these languages and tools is to improve and ease the development of applications. Thus the Fifth PAPP workshop focuses on applications.\nThe PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing and computational science researchers who are potential users of these languages and tools.\nhttp://f.loulergue.free.fr/PAPP2008/index.html" ;

Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, should represent an option never delivered as monotherapy.\nMethods: A 15 yrs old  male patient affected by CESD, diagnosed on the basis of liver steato-fibrosis and LIPA gene mutation, was treated with 10 mg/die for 2 yrs. Biochemical parameters were checked at basal time,6 months,1, 2 yrs since starting therapy. Liver enzymes, lipid profile were tested by standard methods. Inflammatory markers of lipid peroxidation interleukins 1beta (IL1β) and 6 (IL6) were evaluated using western blot analyses. Tranforming growth factor-beta1 (Tgf-beta1), choosen as hepatic fibrosis parameter was evaluated by elisa kit. The serum protein adducts Malonaldehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) were analyzed to test the oxidative damage. Liver elastograpy employed to test liver fibrosis.\nResults:  Liver enzymes normalized by 6 months of therapy; total cholesterol and LDL-C decreased by 30% and 25 % respectively at the same time. IL1β and IL6 decreased after one year of treatment. As well  the oxidative markers malonaldehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) resulted 4,3  0.3 and 6.9± 0.7 AFU/mg protein in basal condition and 3.80.5 and 5.10.5 AFU/mgprotein after 1 yr treatment, so showing a normal value. Tgf-beta1 did not change in agreement with unchanged elastografic  fibrosis.\nConclusion: emphasis for CESD will lead to the disorder being recognized and correctly treated.

In cattle, SCD gene extends over a DNA segment of ~17.0 Kb, and it is organized in 6 exons and 5 introns. The SCD gene has been indicated as the candidate gene to change the saturated/unsaturated FAs ratio and hence it has been\nsuggested as the gene influencing the fat quality. In cattle, eight SNPs have been identified and one of them, (T→C) at 231st nt of 5th exon, is responsible for the Val→Ala amino acid change. The C allele has been associated with higher content of MUFAs in carcasses, and it is positively related to a higher index of desaturation (C18:0/C18:1 and C16:0/C16:1) in the milk. In this study, we report on preliminary results of analysis of transcripts of the SCD\nencoding gene in river buffalo. The electrophoretic analysis of the RT-PCR products and the subsequent sequencing showed at least five different populations of mRNA. The most represented population is correctly assembled (~1300 bp), followed by the one which is deleted of ~750bp, corresponding to the 3rd, 4th and 5th exon and partially to the 2nd and 6th exon." ;

The trials, approved and monitored by the National Institute of Health and by the Ethics Committees, enrolled 19 ALS patients (11 M and 8 F). Patients were followed up for 6-9 months and then treated with autologous BM-MSCs. In addition to the clinical measures, we also analyzed behavioral and quality of life changes.\nEight patients died and 6 patients underwent tracheostomy  for respiratory failure after a mean survival time of  All deaths or tracheostomy were deemed to be unassociated with the experimental treatment. The most important result of our studies is the demonstration of the lack of tumor formations or abnormal cell growth. All patients well tolerated the procedure, the side effects related to the surgery were mild and transient, and there was no deterioration in psychosocial status of patients. Our results showed the safety of MSC transplantation in the central nervous system during a follow-up of nearly 12 years, supporting the MSC-based therapy for neurodegenerative disorders.\nMore recent studies showed that the administration of human MSCs in the cisterna lumbaris of SOD1 G93A mice, providing evidence that this injection can exert strongly positive effects and could be used in outpatient surgery." ;

Among these, correctly placing ligatures on vessels to assure haemostasis is paramount. Aim of this study is to describe an easy-to-make haemostasis simulator that can provide hints about precision and effectiveness of vessel ligature placement.\nMatherials and  Methods: Materials commonly found in every hospital or clinic were used to build the simulator. These are: a column manometer, a 500 ml saline bag, two intravenous fluid lines, a three way stopcock, a syringe and a penrose drainage (6 mm diameter). The simulator has been tested on final year students of veterinary medicine; they performed 40 knots each and “haemostasis” was verified by absence of pressure indicated by the manometer. At the end of the training period, students were asked to fill out a questionnaire  to evaluate the simulator  in terms of improvements in security and technique of  knots realization.\nResults: The simulator was effective in objectively evaluating the students’ ability to place ligatures on vessels. After training with this model, students skills were improved as well as their self-confidence in placing effective haemostatic sutures. They assigned a mean scores of  8,5/10  for the simulator overall assessment, compared to a 6,5/10 for cadaver training.\nConclusion: The simulator resulted reliable and effective in providing the “feel” to properly close a vessel. The model was effective to teach basic surgical skill in open surgery with a very low cost for construction." ;

As phenotipic expression variability, CESD sometimes may be underdiagnosed  or diagnosed late in life.\nWe recently characterized three novel patients affected by CESD.\nCase 1: 3.5-year-old italian female showing persistent liver enzymes elevation, hepatomegaly and combined hyperlipidemia. Blood examination showed: AST 78 UI/l, ALT 92 UI/l, TC 264 mg/dl, TG 178 mg/dl, HDL-C 31 mg/dl, ApoA 80 mg/dl, ApoB 132 mg/dl. \nCase 2: 7-year-old italian male with combined hyperlipidemia, low HDL-C levels and liver enzymes elevation. Blood examination showed: AST 44 UI/l, ALT 59 UI/l, TC 306 mg/dl, TG 173 mg/dl, HDL-C 34 mg/dl, ApoA 85 mg/dl, ApoB 186 mg/dl. Abdominal ultrasonography showed normal liver size with initial stage of periportal fibrosis. \nCase 3: 18-year-old italian male referred to our clinic after a liver biopsy, performed for hepatomegaly and liver enzymes elevation of unknown origin, which showed periportal fibrosis with foamy histiocytes, suggesting CESD diagnosis. Fasting lipid profile showed: TC 292 mg/dl, TG 148 mg/dl and HDL-C 39 mg/dl.  \n\nGenetic analysis were performed by sequencing the LIPA gene:\nCase 1 and 3: both subjects resulted homozygous for LIPA gene mutation c.894 G>A in exon 8 (del p.S275_Q298)\nCase 2: the subject resulted heterozygous for LIPA gene mutation c.894 G>A (del p.S275_Q298) and  c.883 C>T (p.H295Y) in exon 8.\n\nConclusions: \nCESD should more often be considered, since childhood, as a differential diagnosis in liver diseases of unknown origin, when hypertransaminasemia and combined hyperlipidemia with low HDL cholesterol levels occur.

As the smoking epidemic progresses, updates on the development of mortality inequalities attributable to smoking are needed. We provide estimates of relative and absolute educational inequalities in mortality from lung cancer, aerodigestive cancers, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma in Europe and assess the contribution of these smoking-related diseases to inequalities in all-cause mortality.\nMETHODS:\n\nWe use data from 18 European populations covering the time period 1998-2007. We present age-adjusted mortality rates, relative indices of inequality, and slope indices of inequality. We also calculate the contribution of inequalities in smoking-related mortality to inequalities in overall mortality.\nRESULTS:\n\nAmong men, relative inequalities in mortality from the 3 smoking-related causes of death combined are largest in the Czech Republic and Hungary and smallest in Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. Among women, these inequalities are largest in Scotland and Norway and smallest in Italy and Spain. They are often larger among men and tend to be larger for COPD/asthma than for lung and aerodigestive cancers. Relative inequalities in mortality from these conditions are often larger in younger age groups, particularly among women, suggesting a possible further widening of inequalities in mortality in the coming decades. The combined contribution of these diseases to inequality in all-cause mortality varies between 13% and 32% among men and between -5% and 30% among women.\nCONCLUSION:\n\nOur results underline the continuing need for tobacco control policies, which take into account socioeconomic position." ;

The prognostic value of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and non-HDL-cholesterol were demonstrated in adults as accurate index of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, greater than LDL-cholesterol. They should be evaluated also in selected children to predict accurately their CDV risk, but few studies about this aim have been reported in pediatrics.\nObjective: Estimate apoB and non-HDL-C levels and their possible relation to familial CVD in a cohort of children affected by primary dyslipidemias.\nMethods: A healthy and dyslipidemic cohort comprising 351 children and adolescents (2-18 years) was considered. According to international criterias for dyslipidemia’s diagnosis, a 2-generation genealogic tree to detect CVD and lipid proﬁle was estimate by standard methods. Patients resulted: 159 FH, 76 FCHL, 79 Dominant Hypercholesterolemia (ADH), 37 controls. They were also subdivided into 4 age-groups: 0-4.9, 5-9.9, 10-14.9, 15-18.9 years. Statistical analysis were performed by SPSS18.0 software.\nResults: Independently of age, apoB and non-HDL-C levels were significantly higher in children affected by FH (133,5±29 and 219,9±53,5 mg/dl respectively) compared to other groups. Levels in FCHL and ADH patients were similar (apoB=92.6±17.6, non-HDL-C=151,1±29,5 mg/dl and apoB=90±30.6, non-HDL-C=142.7±21.3 mg/dl respectively) but they moved away in adolescence. Among patients, 68,6% had a family history of CVD events (CVD+), and 45,5% positive for precocious events (pCVD+). ApoB and non-HDL-C levels were higher in children CVD+ and pCVD+ but this difference was not statistically significant.\nConclusion: The study showed how apoB and non-HDL-C are relevant biochemical markers to identify the diagnosis in a better way. Furthermore their levels represent an advantage over traditional lipid variables for the risk prediction also in childhood and should be routinely added to the standard lipid profile in children affected by primary dyslipidemia." ;

Similarly, benevolence toward men predicts the perceived legitimacy of gender hierarchy. However, the effects of sexism on men’s and women’s leadership aspiration have not been studied yet. In the present study participants (N = 101) were primed with sexism (Hostile vs. Benevolent) toward their own gender. Results showed that benevolence fosters the possibility of holding a leadership role for men, but harms women from leader positions. Moreover, women consider benevolent and hostile attitudes toward women as similarly prejudiced. On the contrary, men define hostile sexism toward men as more prejudiced than benevolent attitudes." ;

Eighteen patients had anastomotic biliary strictures (in four cases associated with intrahepatic bile duct stenosis). Percutaneous treatment (transhepatic biliary drainage and conventional/cutting balloon dilatation) was proposed as a first approach in 13/18 patients. Strict radiation protection precautions were taken in accordance with the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle. Mean follow-up time was 2,364 days.\nRESULTS:\n\nSurgical correction was required in 3/13 patients; in 8/13 cases, there was complete disappearance of clinical symptoms without bile duct dilatation; in one case, an asymptomatic persistent bile duct dilatation was detected while in the other case, the liver is currently in cirrhotic degeneration (69 % clinical success including the asymptomatic patient with biliary dilatation). Two of the five patients who were initially treated with surgery required percutaneous revision (clinical success of 100 %). There were two cases of long-term restenosis and two cases of transient haemobilia.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nPercutaneous procedures are safe and effective therapeutic options for the treatment of biliary strictures after paediatric liver transplantation." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "INTRODUCTION: The familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is an inborn error of lipid metabolism. The main biochemical features are reduced LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B levels. Its prevalence is 1:500/1000 and the diagnosis is supposed to be underestimated because it is a paucisymptomatic defect. \nAIMS & METHODS: Aim of the study is to detect patients affected by FCBL and to correlate their genotype/phenotype expression. Methods: 38 subjects from 8 kindreds presenting with primary hypocholesterolemia were submitted to lipoprotein analysis, density and gradient ultracentrifugation to separate different fractions, Western Blot to test the apoprotein size and apoB gene sequencing, to detect the mutation (Sequencing System). \nRESULTS: 16/38 patients resulted affected by primary hypobetalipoproteinemia and in 3/8 kindreds 8 cases) the final diagnosis was FHBL, established on the basis of dominant inheritance, biochemical pattern and molecular analysis. 8 patients were children (mean age 13,1 yrs). 3/8 kindreds (4 cases) presented with feeding disorders, 1/8 (1 case) with mental retardation and 7/8 (10 cases, including 2 children) with steatosis and transaminases increased levels. Furthermore irritable bowel and diarrhoea were recurrent symptoms. Three different apo B size were detected and resulted 28.7, 32.4, 39.6 KD and apo B gene mutations resulted respectively in 2-14 base deletions originating stop codons at positions 1306, 1470 and 1773. The latter mutation was never reported before. \nCONCLUSION: : The main recurrent sign related to FHBL, as well in the other kindreds here described and still under analysis, is steatosis and/or steatohepatitis. This condition is an hot topic because the postulated progression to cirrosis and HCC is unknown. Moreover the supposed correlation of the irritable bowel and/or diarrhoea, as well as the steatosis, with a lipid transport defect requires additional studies. This could contribute to define the pathophysiological basis of the disease" ;

Gli studi attualmente in corso sull’uso delle nanotecnologie in ambio medico hanno portato alla formulazione di nuovi sistemi per la veicolazione di farmaci. In particolare nel nostro laboratorio, in collaborazione con il laboratorio della Prof.ssa Cavalli del Dipartimento di Scienza e Tecnologia del Farmaco, sono stati studiati gli effetti della veicolazione di sostanze farmacologicamente attive (butirrato e 5-fluorouracile) mediante nanoparticelle solide lipidiche e microsfere di chitosano. I risultati ottenuti hanno dimostrato che la veicolazione mediante nanosistemi permette l’uso di farmaci a concentrazioni più basse e più intervallate nel tempo rispetto ai farmaci liberi. Inoltre l’utilizzo di sistemi di nano delivery può contribuire a ridurre la comparsa di forme di multi-resistenza, che possono rappresentare un importante ostacolo all’efficacia di terapie antitumorali.\n\nNanotechnology is an emerging branch of science that deals with designing tools and devices of size of 1-100 nm with unique function, at the cellular, atomic and molecular levels.

        dcterms:abstract            "Background\nPerineural fibrotic adhesions are among the major complications of peripheral nerve surgery. While different experimental models have been used for the pre-clinical testing of anti-adherential strategies, the methods used so far to induce scar tissue appear to be poorly standardized and reproducible.\n\nNew method\nThirty adult mice were used. Two methods were tested: the first one is based on burning the perineural muscular bed with a diathermocoagulator, while the second is based on direct scratching of the nerve surface with a cotton swab. After 3 weeks, the fibrotic reaction was assessed by measuring the peak pull out force of the nerve from muscular bed by means of a new tool specifically devised for biomechanical assessment of scar tissue formation. Moreover, histological analysis with specific collagen stain was also carried out.\n\nResults\nBoth methods produced fibrotic reaction. Statistical analysis of biomechanical data showed a significant difference between burning and scratching group compared to the control sham operated group. No significant differences were detected between burning and scratching group. Histological analysis showed the presence of perineural scar tissue in both groups, though with a different distribution pattern.\n\nComparison with other methods\nThis protocol is easier to perform. The tool used for biomechanical evaluation is reliable and cheap.\n\nConclusions\nBoth methods for perineural scar formation are effective and simple. They represent reproducible models for the study of the anti-adherential strategies. Yet, biomechanical testing with the device that we have developed proved to be a reliable and simple method for the quantitative assessment of the degree of perineural adhesion formation." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Criminologists and psychologists have always been interested in exploring the longitudinal patterning of criminal behaviour: how and why it begins, how and why it continues, and how and why it ends. Nonetheless we are still puzzled by the question: Why do individuals continue to offend?\nThis book aims to summarise knowledge about persistent criminal behaviour within the context of criminal careers. It extends this analysis to the realm of criminological psychology and developmental and life-course theories of offending, by using data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), which is a longitudinal study of 411 males whose lives have been followed up from age 8 to age 56.  \n\nThis book goes beyond previous recidivism analyses because the theoretical approach is an integrative one.  It is based on an extensive range of longitudinal data on criminal careers, and also combines official and self-reported delinquency data with an array of psychological, psychiatric, family, school, social, and life-success data collected during a period of over 40 years. The scientific analysis of criminal recidivism is supplemented by case studies of chronic offenders who embarked on a life of crime, making the book  groundbreaking in merging quantitative and qualitative analyses of criminal careers.\n\nThe book identifies key factors that encourage recidivism.  Risk assessment is a central issue because it helps to foster both an accurate evaluation of those criminogenic needs involved in a persistent criminal career, and an identification of those protective factors that aid in the treatment of offenders.   Psychopathy and sex offending are studied according to the Risk-Need-Responsivity model that moves from the static measurement of risk to the dynamic assessment of who to target, and when and how to intervene to stop offenders persisting in their criminal careers." ;

Complications occurred in 14 of 97 patients (14%) and mortality at 30 days was 3%. Long-term results were evaluated in 71 patients who had a least a 6-month follow-up (mean 31 months and range 6-78 months). Eight of 71 patients (11%) had recurrence of stones and 7 of these were successfully retreated transhepatically.

Lesions features and hepatic functional values were recorded for each patient. Two radiologists performed in consensus the analysis of nodules on DYN, HB, and DWI. MR findings were compared with those of pathological anatomy. Diagnostic indicators were calculated for each technique.\nRESULTS:\n\nDYN and HB showed no statistically significant difference in sensitivity (88% and 98%, respectively), diagnostic accuracy (90.6% and 99.9%), and specificity (both 100%), for all Child-Pugh scores, gradings, sizes, and presence or absence of previous treatments. DWI had a statistically significant lower sensitivity compared to DYN (p = 0.001) and HB (p < 0.0001); its sensitivity was significantly inferior for Child-Pugh Class B nodules than for Child-Pugh Class A ones (p = 0.00005). DWI sensitivity presented a significant increase (p = 0.03) with grading and presence of previous treatments (p = 0.0006). ADC values showed no statistically significant changes with Child-Pugh score, grading and nodules size; statistically significant increase was instead found for treated vs. untreated nodules (p = 0.016).\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nIn a multiparametric HCC MRI assessment, DYN and HB play the leading role, with DWI faring acceptably well for Child-Pugh Class A nodules and treated ones." ;

Serum NT-proBNP was centrally measured by immunoenzymatic assay.\nRESULTS:\nNT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in cases than in control subjects [35.4 (15.5-98.2) vs 24.4 (11.7-49.6) pg/mL, p = 0.014]. In logistic regression analysis, compared with NT-proBNP values in the lower quartiles (≤49.64 pg/mL), higher values conferred odds ratio 4.17 (1.30-13.44) of having the MetS, independently of age, sex, microalbuminuria, CRP, eGFR, and central obesity. This association was evident even after the exclusion of hypertensive subjects. Further adjustment for log-HOMA and diastolic blood pressure did not modify the strength of the association, while central obesity was a negative confounder.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nCompared with people without any component of the MetS, those with uncomplicated MetS, who had neither CVD/CKD nor diabetes, had increased NT-proBNP values, even if they were normotensive and although absolute values were still in the low range. The insulin resistance state did not mediate this association, while central obesity was a negative confounder." ;

Through the perspectives of Foucault\nand Bourdieu, different cultural phenomena in modern Japan could be defined as ‘technologies of the self’ and ‘habitus’: the practice of writing among some novelists; the practice of philosophy and (self-) awareness among thinkers influenced by Buddhism; as well as, in a completely different field, the practice of performing arts (dance, theatre, music), or martial arts (budo). The focus is on recognising two commonly spread hermeneutic tendencies: 1. Nihilism in Japan has been more often the problem of the individual than the problem of truth. 2. The debate on the individual and nihilism in Japan has not been dealt with in exclusively intellectual terms. Rather it has immediately referred to practical levels in which the dialectics between technologies of political control and technologies of the self have played a fundamental role." ;

However, some parasites are better than others to exploit the resources offered by their hosts. To date, our understanding of the extent to which some obligate parasites exploit social insect colonies is still limited. In this study, we examined parasite-mediated behavioural alterations of Polistes biglumis wasps parasitized by the obligate social parasite Polistes atrimandibularis by comparing host female-activity in parasitized and non-parasitized colonies. Host foundresses foraged more and rested less in parasitized than in non-parasitized colonies (controlling for the number of larvae in the nest, the time of day, and the day in the season). Next, we used short-term parasite removal experiments to investigate how social parasites manipulate their hosts. We found that parasitized hosts foraged more and rested less when social parasites were on the nest rather than after their removal, and we tested which kind of interactions occurred between parasites and hosts. P. atrimandibularis parasites may use mainly non-aggressive interactions (such as antennation and trophallaxis) to manipulate host activities, rather than visual, acoustic or chemical signals as other parasites do. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg." ;

This paper presents precision results on the mass and transverse momentum spectra of the excess pairs. The space-time averaged rho spectral function associated to the measured mass distribution shows a significant broadening, but essentially no mass shift. The slope parameter $T_{eff}$ extracted from the spectra rises with dimuon mass up to the $\\rho$, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise is consistent with the expectations for radial flow of a hadronic decay source, the decline indicates a transition to an emission source with much smaller flow, possibly of partonic origin." ;

The plots are characterized by a slope of about 15% and a soil classified as Typic Ustorthents, fine-loamy, mixed, calcareous, mesic. Each of them was managed with a different inter-row soil management practice: conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and controlled grass cover (GC), respectively. The rainfall characteristics, runoff discharge and concentration of soil in the water were measured. More than 150 rainfall events producing runoff and 63 erosive events were recorded. The data set was elaborated to investigate the relationships between runoff and soil losses with rainfall amount, duration and intensity, and to evaluate the effects of soil management methods. The amounts of water and soil that ran off the vineyard in the study period varied according to the season, rainfall characteristics and soil surface conditions. The highest soil losses were observed for tilled plots, with values of 111.5 and 207.7 Mg ha−1 in the CT and RT plots, and only 25.6 Mg ha−1 for GC treatment. The worst soil management practice was found to be the RT, whereas the GC was able to reduce soil lost from inter-rows in every season of the year, reaching the best effectiveness in summer (reduction greater than 90%). In addition, GC reduced runoff by 35% compared with the CT plot, showing a greater performance in summer and losing efficacy in autumn. A lower runoff reduction of 11% was observed in RT." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Abstract\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOver the last decades of the 20th century, a widening of the gap in death rates between upper and lower socioeconomic groups has been reported for many European countries. For most countries, it is unknown whether this widening has continued into the first decade of the 21st century.\nMETHODS:\n\nWe collected and harmonised data on mortality by educational level among men and women aged 30-74 years in all countries with available data: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England and Wales, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Lithuania and Estonia.\nRESULTS:\n\nRelative inequalities in premature mortality increased in most populations in the North, West and East of Europe, but not in the South. This was mostly due to smaller proportional reductions in mortality among the lower than the higher educated, but in the case of Lithuania and Estonia, mortality rose among the lower and declined among the higher educated. Mortality among the lower educated rose in many countries for conditions linked to smoking (lung cancer, women only) and excessive alcohol consumption (liver cirrhosis and external causes). In absolute terms, however, reductions in premature mortality were larger among the lower educated in many countries, mainly due to larger absolute reductions in mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer (men only). Despite rising levels of education, population-attributable fractions of lower education for mortality rose in many countries.\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nRelative inequalities in premature mortality have continued to rise in most European countries, and since the 1990s, the contrast between the South (with smaller inequalities) and the East (with larger inequalities) has become stronger. While the population impact of these inequalities has further increased, there are also some encouraging signs of larger absolute reductions in mortality among the lower educated in many countries. Reducing inequalities in mortality critically depends upon speeding up mortality declines among the lower educated, and countering mortality increases from conditions linked to smoking and excessive alcohol consumption such as lung cancer, liver cirrhosis and external causes.\n\nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

All the leaks healed in two weeks, except for one (intrahepatic) that needed two months to heal in association with percutaneous management. The non-surgical treatment of bile leakage is the preferred approach on account of the superior safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness as compared with surgical repair, which is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and costs. The treatment of choice has to be endoscopic, which is much easier and safer than the transhepatic approach, especially in the non-dilated duct, while another advantage over radiology includes the possibility for rapid definitive treatment of distal obstruction (e.g. residual stones). A leak from an extrahepatic duct heals rapidly, while a leak from an intrahepatic duct takes longer to heal and sometimes needs associated percutaneous drainage. Finally, the authors propose treating an extrahepatic bile leak merely with naso-biliary drainage without cutting the papilla, and an intrahepatic bile leak with endoscopic sphincterotomy, nasobiliary drainage and a bilio-duodenal endoprosthesis." ;

The aim of the study was to assess the use of dried plasma (DPS) and blood spots (DBS) to facilitate ARV monitoring in remote settings where clinical monitoring is the primary strategy.\n\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study in HIV-positive ARV-treated patients in Kiremba, Burundi was performed. DBS were used for HIV-1 viral load (limit of the assay 250 copies ml(-1) ) and genotypic drug resistance tests and dried plasma spots were used for concentration measurements.\n\nRESULTS: Three hundred and seven patients [201 female (88.6%), 14 children (4.5%)] were enrolled. HIV-1 viral load was <250, 250-1000 and >1000 copies ml(-1) in 250 (81.7%), 33 (10.8%) and 23 patients (7.5%). Eleven samples out of 23 were successfully amplified revealing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-resistance associated mutations [in seven (58.3%) and six patients (50%)]. Nevirapine trough concentrations were <3000 ng ml(-1) in 28/189 patients (14.8%) and efavirenz 12 h concentrations were <1000 ng ml(-1) in 2/16 patients (12.5%). Children and patients with nevirapine exposure <3000 ng ml(-1) presented a higher risk of viral replication.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Viral loads <250 copies ml(-1) were observed in 81.7% of patients (83.6% adults and 42.9% children). Children and patients with low nevirapine concentrations had higher risk of viral replication. Dried blood and plasma spots may be useful for monitoring HIV-positive patients including viral load and drug level measurement as part of treatment management in remote areas." ;

        dcterms:abstract            "Acting in the real world may be a difficult task for an agent, either software or robotic, because unexpected contingencies\nmay arise at any step of the execution. Previous approaches to robust plan execution consider propositional goals to\nbe achieved and time constraints to be satisfied. However, realistic plans must obey to constraints on continuous/consumable\nresources, too.\nTo face the complexity in handling these resources, the paper proposes the notion of Multi Modality Action (MMA). The\nmodel allows to explicitly express the multiple execution modalities in which a given action can be executed; each execution\nmodality models requirements/consequences on the involved consumable resources when that modality is selected. Relying on\nthe MMA notion, the paper presents how the repair problem can be seen as a problem of reconfiguring actions modalities, and\nhow it can be solved by exploiting a CSP encoding.\nThe MMAs are employed by a new continual planner, FLEX-RR, which, exploiting the synergy from the reconfiguration and a\nnumeric planning mechanism, can efficiently repair on the fly the plan keeping it rather stable. An empirical analysis, performed\non three numeric planning domains, confirms the large benefits of FLEX-RR in terms of competence, efficiency and stability of\nthe repaired plan." ;

On the other hand new information is requested by the market or by public\nagencies: energy balance and life cycle analysis of crop cultivation, labor budget, etc. This\nsituation challenges the farmers, which need standard data and procedures in order to\ncompare the cultivation systems, and to make all the requested assessment. The aim of the\nresearch is contributing to knowledge which can be exploited in designing and evaluating\nbiomass production system, within a standardized system approach. The proposed WEB\napplication, developed with ASP.NET® technology with a SQL server database within the\nframe of the IEE Project Bioenergy Farm allow the user, in anonymous way, to compute its\nown crop cultivation costs, including the use of machinery, manpower, and production factors\nin order to compare different farming systems. Both field and logistic operations could be\nevaluated. The application represents a step toward the standardization of data and calculation\nprocedures for working time, energy balance and operation costs. The interface to the\napplication is provided in English, Italian, Polish, German, Dutch, Estonian and French\nlanguages. The data provided are general (to allow comparison of scenarios between biomass\nproduction processes within the EU) but there is also a local dataset, which allows the user to\ndo calculation with country specific data (e.g. yield range, fuel cost, energy coefficients and so\non). The application also allows detailing the type of field where the cultivation takes place\n(different yield, irrigation type, field shapes and distances). In this way the user could compute\naverage or field specific performance of its farming activities. The short rotation forestry and\nthe forestry activities will be included into the web application as well by may 2011." ;
